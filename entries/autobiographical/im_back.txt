<p>Yes indeed, I am back. Was I ever gone? Well, yes, I've been rather busy
for the last 15 months.</p>

<p>But December 31 was my last day at <a href="http://www.valuesofn.com/"
title="Values of n home page">Values of n</a>. I'm really pleased with the
work I did there. <a href="http://iwantsandy.com/" title="You want sandy,
trust me!">Sandy</a> in particular, was a pleasure to work with. I really
think that the work that Rael and I did with Sandy has been important work.
Dare I say potentially paradigm-shifting? At any rate, I'm convinced that
Sandy is really going to go places. If you haven't signed on to become her
client, do try. Though I will no longer be as intimate with her as I have in
the past, we're still going to keep in touchâ€”I'm still her client. And Rael
will do a great job pushing forward with her.</p>

<p>So why did I leave? Well, the truth is that, after
<a href="http://www.legacy.com/Link.asp?I=LS000091810982X" title="Obituary for
Steven Rappaport">Julie's dad died</a> in July, I found that I no longer had
the resources to commit to the 80-100 hours/week required to work in a
startup. It was just no longer that important to me. Don't get me wrong, it
was rewarding work, but my priorities completely realigned. It was vital that
I continue helping Rael to get Sandy's career launched, but once that was
done, it was time for me to move on.</p>

<p>And what am I doing now? Well, first and foremost, I'm taking a few months
off. I'm going to spend a lot more time re-acquainting myself with the two
terrific women with whom I share a house, and just generally reset myself.
Take a few deep breaths. Relax and enjoy life a bit. Sleep in now and then.
That sort of thing.</p>

<p>That's not to say that I'll be sitting on my ass all the time. I have a
very long list of things I want to do during this time, including catch up on
my blogging (hence the title of this post), fix some bugs in Bricolage and
help get 2.0 out the door, update my Perl libraries (I've got some great ideas
for improving <a href="http://search.cpan.org/SVN-Notify" title="SVN::Notify
on CPAN">SVN::Notify</a>), finally get all my digital photos organized, etc. I
already spent much of last week revamping our mail system (I outsourced it
to <a href="http://www.fusemail.com/" title="FuseMail home
page">FuseMail</a>). And all that's leaving aside all the things Julie and I
want to get done around the house. That's the <em>really</em> important
stuff.</p>

<p>But do watch for more blog posts in the coming months, too. There are a few
interesting things I want to write about, and I've got some serious
catching-up to do. Interested in following along on my
adventures? <a href="https://twitter.com/Theory" title="My Twitter page">Follow
