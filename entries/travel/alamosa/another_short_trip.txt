<p>I made another brief trip to Alamosa last week. This is the first chance
I've had to writ anythying about it! I was doing two days of training for
Adams State Colloge, where they're implementing a campus-wide content
management solution built on Bricolage. But the real reason I'm writing is
because of the neat photos I took. Most of them I took from the plane on
the way in to Alamosa. But the photo of the lobby of the Clarion hotel I stayed
in is, um, <em>interesting</em> as well. Enjoy!</p>
