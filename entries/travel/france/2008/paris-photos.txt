<p>We overnighted in Paris last week. It was a whirlwind visit but we made the best of it. I keep thinking I’ll take the time to blog more about our trip, but keep using my time to process the photos I’ve taken. Honestly, Aperture is still quite a time suck, even in its 2.0 iteration. I might have to try Lightroom one of these days.</p>

<p>At any rate, I’ve gone through about a third of the photos from that trip and have posted them in a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/theory/sets/72157610690990602/" title="Musée D’Orsay, Notre Dame, Centre Pompidou">Flickr photo set</a>. Keep visiting that set over the next few days as I process more of the photos. Then maybe I’ll get to the shots I’ve made here in Rouen!</p>

<p>In the meantime, for much more active blogging of our trip, be sure to visit <a href="http://strongrrl.blogspot.com/" title="Six Semaines en France">Julie’s blog</a>.</p>
