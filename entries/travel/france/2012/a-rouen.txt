We arrived Ã  Rouen just over a week ago. This is our second extended visit, a house exchange with a lovely French couple who’s daughter lives in Portland. We loved our <a href="/travel/france/2008/" title="France 2008">six-week visit in 2008</a>, and were excited to do it again, this time in summer. We will be here another six weeks.</p>

<p>In 2008, I was still an independent consultant. I did a bit of work for <a href="http://etsy.com/">Etsy</a> during our visit, but for the most part did not work. For this visit, I’m grateful to my employer, <a href="http://iovation.com/">iovation</a>, for putting up with my absence and allowing me to work remotely. So far it is working quite well, I think, especially since most of my time is going into <a href="http://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a>, an open-source project.</p>

<p>So I spend my mornings with my family, walking around Rouen, or teaching Anna <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, and my afternoons and evenings most days working. And because we’re here, we can travel around Europe, too. This weekend we go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruges">Bruges</a>. Never been there, but look forward to learning more about it!</p>

<p>Summer is a nice time to be here. We see many more people, and like Portland, people seem happy to see each other on sunny days after a long, wet winter. (Also like Portland, it rains a lot in June.) We’ve also shifted Ms 7’s schedule so that she can be up late with all the other kids.</p>

<p>A few other items of interest:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Julie is blogging our trip on <a href="http://blog.strongrrl.com/">her blog</a>. Read it if you like travel and good writing. Her slice of life stuff is much better than mine. :–)</p></li>
<li><p>Anna now has <a href="http://through-annas-eyes.tumblr.com/">her own blog</a>, too. Check regularly for her photos.</p></li>
<li><p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7266/7447407870_71d68c6d90_n.jpg" title="Delicious, delicious cidre" alt="Cidre" /> Man oh man is the cider good here. Along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvados">Calvados</a>, it is the regional drink of choice. Even the cheap grocery store stuff is amazing. It’s especially good <a href="http://blog.strongrrl.com/2012/06/how-french-do-lunch.html">for lunch</a>!</p></li>
<li><p>I’m mostly taking pictures with Instagram; see <a href="http://justatheory.tumblr.com/">my Tubmblog</a> to follow along. I will also get out my DSLR some, though so fare I haven’t.</p></li>
<li><p>I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/theory/status/216155640131883008">via Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/david.e.wheeler/posts/10150891340703693">via Facebook</a>: “Pop quiz: How many  devices does a family of three (parents, 7yo daughter) take for a 7 week house exchange in France? #”. I know many of you are waiting on the answer, so here it is: 7:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 iPhones</li>
<li>2 iPads</li>
<li>2 MacBook Airs</li>
<li>1 TV</li>
</ul>


<p>(Although <a href="https://twitter.com/darth/status/216179141773504512">Darth thinks we should have brought an iMac in the kid’s backpack</a>, it did not seem practical).
The TV was a last-minute purchase, because I knew ahead of time that the house had an HDMI projector and optical-ready surround-sound system, so it seemed the best way to keep up with our shows. Haven’t used it much, yet. Everyone is reading on the iPads, though; Ms 7 has a <em>very</em> expensive reading habit!</p></li>
