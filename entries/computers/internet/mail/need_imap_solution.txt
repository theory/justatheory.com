Need Suggestions for IMAP Solution and Migration
meta-keywords: IMAP, email
meta-description: <p>I'm soliciting advice for a solid IMAP-based mail solution. I've had my own IMAP server and have recently been burned by moving all of our gigabytes of mail to a mail services company. No backups, missing mail, slow performance. The full scoop after the jump, but ultimately, I'd like suggestions for where to go next.</p>

<p>For the last several years, I've run
a <a href="http://www.courier-mta.org/imap/" title="Courier-IMAP
Home">Courier-IMAP</a> mail server for all of the mail for <a href="/"
title="Just a Theory">this site</a>, <a href="http://www.kineticode.com/"
title="Kineticode Home">Kineticode</a>, <a href="http://www.strongrrl.com/"
title="Strongrrl Home">Strongrrl</a> and other domains. We mainly used
Mail.app on Mac OS X to communicate with the server, and it worked really
well. Today,
<a href="http://www.strongrrl.com/" title="Julie Wheeler is principal at
Strongrrl">Julie</a> has over 3 GB of mail data, and I have around 1.5 GB, all
managed via IMAP.</p>

<p>Recently, I decided it was time to move the mail elsewhere. I've been
meaning to do it for a while, primarily because the server I was using is now
used for the <a href="http://bricolage.cc" title="Bricolage CMS
Home">Bricolage</a> project, and because I never set up any spam filtering.
Julie was suddenly getting 100s of spam messages in her inbox. (It really
didn't help that she was still using Panther.) So on the advice of a good
friend who had been evaluating various mail services--and who for now
shall go nameless and therefor blameless--I moved all of our mail to
<a href="http://www.fusemail.com/" title="FuseMail Home">FuseMail</a>.</p>

<p>At first this seamed like a pretty good solution. Our spam rates went way
down, I could set up unlimited mail lists, aliases, and forwards, and
there was a migration tool that automated moving all of our existing
mail from the old IMAP server to the new one. There were some glitches with
the migration tool, but in the end all of our mail was moved and in tact.</p>

<p>But that's when I started to notice the issues. To summarize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mail put into the <q>Sent Items</q> folder by Mail.app was marked as
  unread. This didn't happen on the old server, and apparently has something
  to so with how FuseMail names the sent folder: <q>Sent Items</q> rather
  than <q>Sent Messages.</q></li>
  <li>Mail.app is syncing <em>constantly</em>. Even once it had successfully
  synced the all of our email in all of our IMAP folders (which took
  <em>days</em>, it is syncing all the time, to the extent that I am sometimes
  waiting for up to a minute to read a mail when I double-click it, because
  there are all these other threads doing stuff and taking up all the
  resources. It can take several minutes for mail I'm sending to
  be <em>sent</em> (though that might be a delay in Mail.app copying the
  message to the Sent Items folder rather than the actual sending).</li>
  <li>Deleting mail takes for<em>ever!</em> This is probably the same issue as
  the syncing problem, but when I delete 1000s of messages from my Junk mail
  folder, it runs forever, and all other activities are delayed eve further.
  It turns out to be much more efficient to empty the Junk and Deleted Items
  folders using the webmail interface. And even then, Mail.app can take a
  while to delete locally-cached items from the folder when it syncs.</li>
  <li>Suddenly, Julie is getting a lot less spam. She went from several
  hundred messages showing up in her Junk mailbox a few days ago to just five
  on Friday and two yesterday--one of which was a false positive). As she had
  been expecting a message from someone that she never got, this naturally
  made her very suspicious. Where is all the spam? Is she getting all of her
  mail?</li>
  <li>Since FuseMail uses a mailbox named <q>Sent Items</q> instead of the
  traditional <q>Sent Messages</q> for all sent mail, I asked if they could
  move the 1.8 GB of messages from Julie's Sent Messages to their Sent Items,
  since Mail.app would just choke on such a task. Though my request was
  escalated to the FuseMail developers, the answer came back <q>no.</q> Which
  I guess means that they're not
  using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir" title="Maildir as
  described by Wikipedia">Maildir</a>, because in that case it would be a
  cinch, n'est pas?</li>
  <li>Backups are not really feasible. Of course FuseMail has its own
  backup regimen, but if I ever want to move elsewhere or deal with some
  sort of catastrophic failure, I want my own backups. There is no
  rsync service available for this (remember: no maildir), so I have to
  use the IMAP interface. I've been trying for the past two weeks to get
  <a href="http://software.complete.org/offlineimap" title="OfflineIMAP
  Home">Offline IMAP</a> to back up all of Julie's and my mail, but it keeps
  choking. It gets a little further every time I run it; eventually it will
  get it all. But this only allows me to backup those accounts for which I
  happen to have a password. I have accounts set up for a few other users, but
  don't have access to their passwords, so I can't back them up. This does not
  make for very good support for corporate backup and retention
  policies.</li>
  <li>Mail forwarded by FuseMail has its <code>Return-Path</code> header
  modified. This made <a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/"
  title="Request Tracker Home">RT</a> break until I hacked it to ignore that
  header (which is its by-default preferred header for identifying
  senders.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I'm pretty fed up. It took me a week to get all of our mail on FuseMail,
and now I'm looking at moving it off again (once OfflineIMAP finishes a full
sync). Grr. I'm considering finding a virtual host somewhere and setting up my
own IMAP server again, but then I have the spam problem again. So then I could
use a forwarding service like <a href="http://www.pobox.com/" title="Pobox Home">Pobox</a>, or I can set up my own spam filtering (something I had hoped
never to get into managing myself). My old IMAP server required very little
maintenance, which was nice, but then the span filtering stuff always seemed
daunting. Don't you have to update things all the time?a</p>

<p>But before I go off and do something else, and unlike before I moved to
FuseMail, I wanted to get an idea what other folks are doing? Do you use IMAP?
Do you use it to manage a shitload (read: Gigabytes) of mail? Do you get very
little spam and still get all of your valid mail? Are IMAP folder maintenance
actions fast for you (in Mail.app in particular)? Are you paying a
not-unreasonable amount of money for your setup? If you answered yes to all of
these questions, please, for the love of all that is good in this world, tell
me how you do it. I'm looking for something that I don't have to work very
hard to maintain (hence my original attempt to have some company that
specializes in this stuff do it), but I'll do what I have to to make this
thing right. So how do you make it right? And if I have to run my own server,
where should I host it that won't cost me an arm and a leg?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
