New Just a Theory Blog Policy: Limited Comment Period
meta-keywords: blog, comment, spam, junk

<p>I've had an open policy on comments on this blog since it started. A couple years ago, I added a timeout on trackback pings, so that you can't trackback ping a posting more than two weeks after I wrote it. But I left manual comments in, along with the simple math bit, since comments and spam have been low volume.</p>

<p>Curiously, though, although this is not a popular blog, and I've posted to it all of twice in the last six months, I've been getting a lot more comment spam in the last few weeks. I've been having to manually delete upwards of 100 spam comments a day. Well, I'm bored with that. So I hereby announce a new comment policy: You can comment on a blog post for up to two weeks after I post it. After that, the comment period will be over. I'm sorry to have to do this, and maybe it will change if I ever switch to Word Press or something, but for now, I think it will do.</p>

<p>The vast majority of non-spam comments I get on any particular post after two weeks or so is a request for support. So I don't think that the new policy will hamper anyone much, and for those looking for support, well, this is not the appropriate forum. But if you <em>do</em> feel compelled to comment on something after the comment period, just email your comment to me and I'll add it in as I deem appropriate.</p>

<p>Thanks for understanding. I really appreciate getting this time back every day. And, of course, if you'd like to respond to this new policy in any way, well, you have two weeks to leave a comment on this post. ;-)</p>
