<p>I notice a number of places recently where some blogs had a nice array of small icons to make it easy for readers to add particular entries to their favorite social bookmarking sites. The example I noticed most recently was on <a href="http://simplemom.net/" title="Simple Mom">Simple Mom</a>. After a bit of digging, I found the <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/sociable/" title="Sociable Plugin home page">Sociable plugin for WordPress</a>. It had just the format I was looking for.</p>

<p>So today I ported it to Blosxom. You can get it yourself <a href="/downloads/sociable-1.0">here</a>. You'll also need to download the <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/sociable/" title="Sociable Plugin home page">Sociable WordPress plugin</a> so that you can get all the necessary images and styling. Read the docs for how to use it; it's pretty simple, and supports a <em>lot</em> of social bookmarking sites, and even good ’ole “Email” and “Print” links.</p>

<p>And of course, also starting today, you can see the links right here on my site. So, yeah, go ahead and link me up!</p>
