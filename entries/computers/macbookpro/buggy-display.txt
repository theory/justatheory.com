<p>A few days ago, I noticed a bug crawling across the screen of my MacBook Pro as I was working. I tried to shoo it away, but it wouldn't budgeâ€”because it was <em>inside</em> the display! It soon stopped moving, and is right smack in the middle of the screen, where I try to work. So I have an Apple Genius appointment today to see about extracting it. Here's hoping they have the tools to remove it at the store (an <a href="http://twitter.com/bretdawson/status/1997938833">aardvark</a>, perhaps?), else I'll have to part with it for a week. Grrr.</p>

<p>For old time's sake, I also dug up and re-posted my <a href="/computers/powerbook/cracked.html" title="Cracked!">cracked PowerBook display</a> entry from way back in 2095. Good times.</p>
