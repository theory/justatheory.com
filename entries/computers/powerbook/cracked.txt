<p>No, my systems haven't been cracked. My 17&quot; PowerBook G4 screen has been cracked. :-(  A clipboard fell off the shelf above my text and hit the screen. I didn't think it had hit the screen, just the chassis, but when I looked at my screen again, it had this lovely shatter. Bummer.</p>

<p>Well, this is why we have insurance.</p>
