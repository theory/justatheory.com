<p>Over the last year or so, we&rsquo;ve been on a &ldquo;clear out the junk&rdquo; kick in our house. We&rsquo;ve gotten rid of all of our CDs, most of our books, and a lot of clutter and crap in our house. It&rsquo;s kind of funny, because as a former academic, I&rsquo;ve always liked having stuff, especially lots of books. But no more. I mainly want to read books on my iPad or iPhone nowadays and have less <em>clutter</em> in the house. I&rsquo;m at the point now that, when I saw <a href="http://www.panic.com/tribute/steve.html">Panic&rsquo;s commemoration of Steve Jobs</a> yesterday &mdash; featuring a recently-discovered photo of Steve sitting on the floor or his house with nothing but a lamp, a stereo, and a mug of tea &mdash; I thought to myself, &ldquo;now that&rsquo;s about right.&rdquo; Nothing but the essentials.</p>

<p>I think that Steve&rsquo;s philosophy of minimalism applies just as well to most Mac products. I don&rsquo;t mean only not in the way most folks have discussed ad nauseum: the simple interfaces, few buttons, smooth edges. But also in the quality. Apple products are meant to be used &mdash; <em>well</em> used &mdash; for a long time. Macs famously last longer than PCs, and the build quality of the unibody MacBook Pros, Airs, iPhones, and iPads, is universally lauded. I&rsquo;ve had a few iPhones since 2007, and have always managed to get a good price for them via Craig&rsquo;s List, not only because people <em>want</em> them, but because they were still in good shape after extended use. These products are meant to <em>last.</em></p>

<p>Marco Arment&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/10/07/review-79-kindle-with-ads-and-buttons">$79 Kindle review</a> catalyzed these thoughts for me. The words that really struck me were &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; and &ldquo;disposable.&rdquo; The new low-end Kindle is designed to be disposable. Money quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Knowing that this new Kindle costs less than the cover for my Kindle 2 is freeing: I can just carry it around uncased and unprotected in a (large) pocket, use it anywhere, and not worry about damaging an expensive electronic item, because it’s not. And it’s so inexpensive that I have no hesitation recommending it to pretty much anyone who ever reads books, because I know that if they end up disliking it or not using it much, it wasn’t a lot of money.</p></blockquote>

<p>It also means that, if you have it for six or twelve months and it breaks, it&rsquo;s not a big deal to buy another one. A year later, another. Pretty soon you have a bunch of these things in your house, collecting like corpses in a cemetery. Because they&rsquo;re so cheap to begin with, once they break, they&rsquo;re not worth anything at all. You won&rsquo;t be able to sell them to anyone. They&rsquo;re just junk at that point.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m over junk culture. I hate wasteful packaging, but even worse is wasteful products. I don&rsquo;t want a cheap, crappy Kindle, because in a year it will just be more trash &mdash; either additional household clutter or landfill. We already generate way too much waste, especially in the US. I think it&rsquo;s a much better investment to buy a product with good build quality, that&rsquo;s built to last. Not only will my iPad last me for years, but it will still have value years from now. It&rsquo;s far more likely that it will still be functional in two years than the $79 Kindle will be, or even two or three Kindles.</p>

<p>The iPad is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RMGVU8/">Contigo thermal mug</a>; the Kindle is a <a href="http://www.dixie.com/prdct-cups.html">Dixie cup</a>. I&rsquo;ll take the quality and durability every time. Longer term, it likely won&rsquo;t cost me any more &mdash; and certainly costs the planet less.</p>
