SVN::Notify 2.22 Improves Diff Parsing
meta-keywords: SVN::Notify, Perl, Subversion, SVN::Notify::HTML, SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff, diff, patch

<p>I released SVN::Notify 2.22 last night. The new version fixes a few issues in the parsing of diffs in the HTML subclasses. SVN::Notify::HTML now properly identifies added, deleted, and property setting sections of an included diff file when creating IDs. The lists of the affected files near the top of the email links down into the diff, and now also includes links to the locations in the diff for files that have had only their properties changed.</p>

<p>SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff had similar updates. It now properly outputs added and deleted files in the diff in separate sections, instead of grouping them under the last modified file listed. It also creates separate sections for files that have only had their properties changed. I've put an example <a href="/computers/programming/perl/modules/svnnotify-2.22_colordiff_example.html" title="SVN::Notify 2.22 sample ColorDiff output">here</a>.</p>

<p>Grab the new version from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/SVN-Notify/" title="SVN::Notify on CPAN">CPAN</a> now</p>
