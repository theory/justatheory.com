SVN::Notify 2.20 Adds Colorized Diffs
meta-keywords: Perl, Subversion, CVSspam, Perl, module, SVN::Notify, svnnotify, diff, patch, color, HTML

<p>After getting prodded by <a href="http://www.blogscene.org/erik" title="Erik Hatcher - Blog">Erik Hatcher</a>, I went ahead and added another subclass to SVN::Notify. This one adds a pretty colorized diff to the message, instead of just the plain text one. See an example <a href="/computers/programming/perl/modules/svnnotify_colordiff_example.html" title="SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff example">here</a>. I've also added links from the lists of affected files into the diffs in the HTML and new HTML::ColorDiff layouts.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> And now I've released SVN::Notify 2.21 with a few minor fixes, including XHTML 1.1 compliance.</p>
