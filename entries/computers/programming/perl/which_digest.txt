Which Digest Should I Use?
meta-keywords: MD5, SHA1, SHA2, Whirpool, Tiger, Haval256, password, hash, algorithm, collision

<p>With the recent <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/11/15/2037232">release of MD5 collision code</a>, I'm reading that it's long since time that MD5 was dropped from applications. But it seems that SHA-1 isn't well-thought of anymore, either. So what should Perl programmers use now, instead?  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Digest-Whirlpool/">Digest::Whirlpool</a>? <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Digest-SHA1/">Digest::SHA2</a>? <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Digest-Tiger/">Digest::Tiger</a>? <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Digest-Haval256/">Digest::Haval256</a>? A combination of these? Something else? I mainly used MD5 for hasing passwords. What's the best choice for that use? For other uses?</p>
