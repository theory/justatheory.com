<p><a href="http://annocpan.org/~DWHEELER/FSA-Rules-0.23/lib/FSA/Rules.pm" title="FSA::Rules on AnnoCPAN">This is pretty cool</a>. Chris Dolan added a comment about the synopsis, pointing out that it is overly complicated (yes, Chris, it's that way to show off the features). But I love that a user can take the time to comment on my docs and therefore make them even better!</p>
