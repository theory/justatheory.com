Adding a Git SHA1 to your Xcode Project

<p>I found a <a href="http://www.cimgf.com/2008/04/13/git-and-xcode-a-git-build-number-script/">decent Perl script</a> for adding a Git SHA1 to an Xcode project last week. However, since by day I’m actually a <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~dwheeler/">Perl hacker</a>, I couldn’t help finessing it a bit. Here are the steps to add it to your project:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Open your project settings (Project –> Edit Project Settings) and in the “Build” tab, make sure that “Info.plist Output Encoding” is set to “xml”. I lost about an hour of fiddling before I realized that my plist file was binary, which of course couldn’t really be parsed by the simple Perl script.</p></li>
<li><p>Edit your app’s Info.plist file. If you want the version to be the SHA1, set “Bundle Version” to “0x000”. I personally prefer to have a separate key for the SHA1, so I created the “LTGitSHA1” key and set its value to “0x000”. This is the placeholder value that will be replaced when your app runs.</p></li>
<li><p>Right-click your target app and select Add –> New Build Phase –> New Run Script Build Phase. For the shell command, enter:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/env perl -wpi -0777
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Paste this into the “Script” field:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl -wpi -0777
# Xcode auto-versioning script for Subversion by Axel Andersson
# Updated for git by Marcus S. Zarra and Matt Long
# Refactored by David E. Wheeler.

BEGIN {
    @ARGV = ("$ENV{BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/$ENV{INFOPLIST_PATH}");
    ($sha1 = `git rev-parse --short HEAD`) =~ s/\s+$//;
}

s{0x000}{$sha1};
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Fetch the value in your code from your bundle, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(
    @"SHA1: %@",
    [[[NSBundle mainBundle]infoDictionary]objectForKey:@"LTGitSHA1"]
);
</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<p>That’s it. If you want to use a placeholder other than “0x0000”, just change it on the last line of the script.</p>
