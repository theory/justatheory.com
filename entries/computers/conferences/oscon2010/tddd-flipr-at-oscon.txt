<p>A sneak peak at what I'm working on for my <a href="http://bit.ly/9VYmEZ" title="Test Driven Database Development">tutorial session</a> at <a href="http://www.oscon.com/">OSCON</a>. Be there at 8:30 Monday morning for the important details. You're sure to find my new venture excitingâ€”perhaps the most important social media announcement of 2010. You can't afford to miss that, can you?</p>
