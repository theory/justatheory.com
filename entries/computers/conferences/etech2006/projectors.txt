What's with the Ancient Projectors?
tags: projectors conferences etech etech06

<p>I'm at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/" title="The
Emerging Technology Conference home page">ETech</a>, where there have been
some great presentations. But during his keynote this morning, Jon Udell
momentarily had a problem where the window he was using was larger than his
screen real estate. And this reminded me of one of my pet peeves.</p>

<p><em>Why the hell do conference projectors <strong>still</strong> support a
resolution of no more than 800 x 600?!</em> There is simply no excuse for
this anymore--and there hasn't been for, what, a decade?</p>

<p>That is all. Thank you.</p>
