<p>My <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2004/view/e_sess/5312" title="Discovering Bricolage Description">presentation</a> went off well yesterday. It was in a small room, and I was delighted to find that it was standing room only. Several people told me later that they weren't able to even get into the room. I told <a href="http://use.perl.org/~gnat/journal/" title="Nat's Journal">Nat</a> that next year he'd have to give me a keynote.</p>

<p>This is a new version of my usual presentation. It simplifies some things, and uses the new <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/" title="Bricolage Website">Bricolage Website</a> for its example. I think that it was positively received. I've worked hard to try to make the presentation engaging, and it was nice that I didn't lose my audience; no one left during the presentation that I noticed (although it was mighty crowded in the back!). So I'm happy with it.</p>

<p>I exported the presentation to PDF, and added the movie that runs at the beginning as a set of slides ahead of the main presentation content. You can <a href="http://www.kineticode.com/docs/discovering_bricolage.pdf" title="Download discovering_bricolage.pdf">download</a> the presentation from the <a href="http://www.kineticode.com/" title="Kineticode Website">Kineticode</a> Website.</p>
