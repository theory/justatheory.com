<p>Just a quick post to announce that I’ve set up a
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sqitch-users">Sqitch Google Group</a>. I’ve been
getting a lot more email about it lately, and a fair bit of it should be shared more
generally. So if you’re interested in Sqitch, sign up! (Don’t like web forums? Me neither.
Feel free to <a href="mailto:sqitch-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com">subscribe by email</a>, instead.)</p>
