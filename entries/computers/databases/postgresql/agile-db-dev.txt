<p>I gave a tutorial at <a href="http://www.pgcon.org/2013/">PGCon</a> a couple weeks back, entitled “<a href="http://www.pgcon.org/2013/schedule/events/615.en.html">Agile Database Development</a> with Git, Sqitch, and pgTAP.” It went well, I think. The Keynote document and an exported PDF have been <a href="http://www.pgcon.org/2013/schedule/events/615.en.html">posted on PGCon.org</a>, and also uploaded to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/theory/agile-database-development">Speaker Deck</a>. And embedded below, too. Want to follow along? Clone the <a href="https://github.com/theory/agile-flipr">tutorial Git repository</a> and follow along. Here’s the teaser:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi, I’m David. I like to write database apps. Just as much as I like to
write web apps. (Maybe more!) How? Not by relying on bolted-on, half-baked
database integration tools like migrations, I’ll tell you that!. Instead, I
make extensive use of best-of-breed tools for source control
(<a href="http://git-scm.org/">Git</a>), database unit testing
(<a href="http://pgtap.org/">pgTAP</a>), and database change management and deployment
(<a href="http://sqitch.org/">Sqitch</a>). If you’d like to get as much pleasure out of
database development as you do application development, join me for this
tutorial. We’ll develop a sample application using the processes and tools
I’ve come to depend on, and you’ll find out whether they might work for you.
Either way, I promise it will at least be an amusing use of your time.</p></blockquote>
