PGAN Bikeshedding
meta-description: <p>Help me pick a good name for the PostgreSQL extension distribution network and site.</p>
meta-keywords: PostgreSQL, PGAN, CPAN, extension, distribution
tags: PostgreSQL PGAN CPAN extension distribution

<p>I’ve put together a <a href="http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PGAN">description of PGAN</a>, the PostgreSQL extension distribution system I plan to develop later this year based on the Comprehensive Archive Perl Network or <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>. Its primary features will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extension distribution</li>
<li>Search site with extension documentation</li>
<li>Client for downloading, building, testing, and installing extensions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve never been thrilled with the name, though, so I’m asking for suggestions for a better one. I’ve used the term "extension" here because it seems to be the term that the PostgreSQL community has <a href="http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/ExtensionPackaging">settled on</a>, but other terms might work, since things other than extensions might be distributed.</p>

<p>What I’ve come up with so far is:</p>

<table>
  <thead><tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Long Name</th>
    <th>Pronounciation</th>
    <th>Advantages</th>
    <th>Disadvantages</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tr class="odd">
    <td>PGAN</td>
    <td>PostgreSQL Add-on Network</td>
    <td>pee-gan</td>
    <td>Short, similar to CPAN</td>
    <td>Ugly</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PGEX</td>
    <td>PostgreSQL Extensions</td>
    <td>pee-gee-ex or pee-gex</td>
    <td>Short, easier to pronounce</td>
    <td>Too similar to <a href="http://pgexperts.com/">PGX</a>)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <td>PGCAN</td>
    <td>PostgreSQL Comprehensive Archive Network</td>
    <td>pee-gee-can</td>
    <td>Similar to CPAN</td>
    <td>Similar to CPAN</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PGDAN</td>
    <td>PostgreSQL Distribution Archive Network</td>
    <td>pee-gee-dan</td>
    <td>Short, easy to pronounce</td>
    <td>Who’s “Dan”? Doesn’t distribute PostgreSQL itself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <td>PGEDAN</td>
    <td>PostgreSQL Extension Distribution Archive Network</td>
    <td>pee-gee-ee-dan</td>
    <td>References extensions</td>
    <td>Long, sounds stupid</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Of these, I think I like “PGEX” best, but none are really great. So I’m opening up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_Law_of_Triviality">bike shed</a> to all. What’s a better name? Or if you can’t think of one, which of the above do you like best? Just leave a comment on this post. The only requirements for suggestions are that a .org domain be available and that it suck less than the alternatives.</p>
