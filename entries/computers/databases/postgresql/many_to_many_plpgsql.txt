<p>The second in my series of articles on programming PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL,
<q>Managing Many-to-Many Relationships with PL/pgSQL</q>, has just been
published <a

title="Read &#x201c;Managing Many-to-Many Relationships with
PL/pgSQL&#x201d;">onLamp.com</a>. The idea is to abstract out of the
application layer the management of the many-to-many relationships, moving it
into the database layer where execution is both safer and faster. And you can
learn more about PL/pgSQL along the way.</p>
