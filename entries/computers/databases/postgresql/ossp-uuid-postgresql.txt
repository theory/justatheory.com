PostgreSQL + OSSP UUID on Mac OS X

<p>Wanted to get this down since I just dealt with it for the second time in
the last year. The issue is this: If you
have <a href="http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/">OSSP uuid</a> installed on Mac
OS X, and you want to build PostgreSQL with OSSP uuid support, you pass
<code>--with-ossp-uuid</code> to PostgreSQL's <code>configure</code> script.
However, you might notice this in the output:</p>

<pre>
checking ossp/uuid.h usability... no
checking ossp/uuid.h presence... yes
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h: present but cannot be compiled
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h:     check for missing prerequisite headers?
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h: see the Autoconf documentation
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h:     section &quot;Present But Cannot Be Compiled&quot;
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h: proceeding with the preprocessor&#x0027;s result
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h: in the future, the compiler will take precedence
configure: WARNING:     ## ---------------------------------------- ##
configure: WARNING:     ## Report this to pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org ##
configure: WARNING:     ## ---------------------------------------- ##
checking for ossp/uuid.h... yes
</pre>

<p>The reason for this message is that OSSP uuid has symbols that conflicts
those included with Mac OS X. If you look in <code>config.log</code>, you'll
see something like this:</p>

<pre>
configure:13224: checking ossp/uuid.h usability
configure:13241: gcc -no-cpp-precomp -c -O2 -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wendif-labels -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv  -I/usr/local/include/libxml2  -I/usr/local/include conftest.c &gt;&amp;5
In file included from conftest.c:98:
/usr/local/include/ossp/uuid.h:94: error: conflicting types for &#x0027;uuid_t&#x0027;
/usr/include/unistd.h:133: error: previous declaration of &#x0027;uuid_t&#x0027; was here
</pre>

<p>It turns out that I <a href="http://cvs.ossp.org/tktview?tn=164"
title="OSSP Ticket 164: Header doesn't work if &lt;unistd.h&gt; is included
first">reported</a> this issue to OSSP a while ago. For PostgreSQL, at least
it doesn't seem to be much of a problem: the build continues and I'm able to
install the ossp-uuid contrib module without a problem. So the upshot is:
<strong>you can ignore the above warning!</strong></p>

<p>One recommendation I <em>do</em> have, however, is to install the OSSP uuid
header file in a non-default location. Why? Because if you build Apache and APR
from source, like I do, you'll get the same failure because of conflicting
<code>uuid_t</code> symbols, and APR will fail to actually build! So I pass
<code>--includedir=/usr/local/include/ossp</code> to OSSP uuid's configure.
This has no effect on how OSSP uuid itself behaves, and the PostgreSQL is
smart enough to look there without having to be told. Meanwhile, it will then
be out of the way of your APR build (assuming you
delete <code>/usr/local/include/uuid.h</code>
or <code>/usr/include/uuid.h</code>).</p>
