How to Determine Your Transaction ID
meta-keywords: PostgreSQL, SQL, transaction, transaction ID, DBI, DBD::Pg, Perl

<p>Today I had reason to find out what PostgreSQL transaction I was in the middle of at any given moment in Bricolage. Why? I wanted to make sure that a single request was generating multiple transactions, instead of the normal one. It's a long story, but suffice it to say that lengthy transactions were causing deadlocks. Read <a href="http://bugs.bricolage.cc/show_bug.cgi?id=709#c19" title="Bug report: Deadlocks during Bricolage publishes">this</a> if you're really interested.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's how to determine your current transaction using DBI. The query will be the same for any client, of course.</p>

<pre>
my $sth = $dbh->prepare(qq{
    SELECT transaction
    FROM   pg_locks
    WHERE  pid = pg_backend_pid()
           AND transaction IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT  1
});

$sth->execute;
$sth->bind_columns(\my $txid);
$sth->fetch;
print &quot;Transaction: $txid\n&quot;;
</pre>
