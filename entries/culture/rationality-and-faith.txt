<p>I got an invitation to write on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> a couple weeks ago. I have been pondering some more philosophical posts lately, so I thought I’d try posting there. My first post, “<a href="https://medium.com/on-culture/11cfd5b919f6">Misguided Delusion</a>,” tries to pull apart the the false dichotomy between faith and rationality. Yeah, really. That kind of thinking is a throwback to a <a href="/autobiographical/five_things.html">previous career path</a>, but one that has, of course, always stuck with me. And I am very happy with how the post turned out.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether or not I write more stuff like that. It’s rewarding, but time-consuming.</p>
