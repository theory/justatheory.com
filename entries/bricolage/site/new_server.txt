Bricolage.cc Has a New Server
meta-keywords: Bricolage, bricolage.cc, www.bricolage.cc, Bricolage API browser

<p>The Bricolage project has a <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/">new
server</a>! Thanks to a generous donation from
<a href="http://www.netstumbler.com/">NetStumbler.com</a>, we have a shiny new
hosted FreeBSD server. I've started building it, and have migrated the
Bricolage Web site over today. By tomorrow, DNS records should be updated, and
it'll be rarin' to go!</p>

<p>While I was at it, I rolled out the new Bricolage API documentation
browser. There are now browser available for all of the major stable releases
of Bricolage, listed on the old <a
href="http://www.bricolage.cc/documentation.html">documentation page</a>. The
API browser for the current stable release will always be available
<a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/docs/api/current/">here</a>. Meanwhile, the
documentation will also be generated from the Subversion trunk every morning;
you can find those docs <a
href="http://www.bricolage.cc/docs/api/devel/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We'll also be able to keep better track of the kind of traffic the site
gets thanks to the new <a href="http://stats.bricolage.cc/">stats site</a>,
which will also be updated daily.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
