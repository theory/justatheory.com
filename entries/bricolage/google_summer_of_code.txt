Bricolage a Google Summer of Code Project
meta-keywords: Google, Summer of Code, Bricolage, mentor, grant, pay

<p>The Bricolage project is pleased to have been selected to be a partner in
the Google <a href=" http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of
Code</a>.  This Initiative is designed to introduce students to the world of
Open Source Software Development and provide them with a $4500 award for
completing an Open Source project before the end of Summer.</p>

<p>As a partner, we are currently looking for student volunteers to propose
Bricolage development projects. We have created
a <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/dev/summer_of_code/">list of suggested
project ideas</a>. If you're interested in hacking on Bricolage for fame and
fortune, join the <a href="http://www.bricolage.cc/support/lists/"
title="Bricolage Mail List Subscription">Bricolage Developers</a> mail list or
sign on to <code>#bricolage</code> on irc.develooper.org (MagNet) to outline
your proposal and get feedback as you prepare to submit it to Google. You can
also join the
Google <a
href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/summer-discuss">Summer-Discuss</a>
group or sign on to <code>#google-summer</code> on irc.freenode.net for more
general discussion of the Summer of Code.</p>

<p>But hurry, the deadline for proposal submissions is June 14! Students who get Bricolage projects accepted will be mentored by me and other members of the Bricolage community.</p>

<p>We look forward to your proposals!</p>
