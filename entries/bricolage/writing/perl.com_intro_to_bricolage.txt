<p><a href="http://www.perl.com/" title="Perl.com"><cite>Perl.com</cite></a>
has published the first in a series of articles I've promised to write, <a
href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/08/27/bricolage.html" title="Content
Management with Bricolage"><q>Content Management with Bricolage.</q></a> The
article is targeted at organizational decision makers who need to evaluate
Bricolage as part of their selection of a content management solution. So I've
spent some time discussing what content management is and how Bricolage fits
in. I mention a lot of other CMSes as for comparative purposes, to try to
really give people a feel for how Bricolage can meet their needs.</p>

<p>I also go over some of Bricolage's most important features, such as
multisite management, document modeling, Perl templating, meaningful URLs,
workflow, and any number of outputs via <q>output channels.</q> The article
concludes with a list of sites known to be managed by Bricolage, as well as
the promise for more.</p>

<p>The next article in the series will cover installation and configuration.
Subsequent articles will cover document analysis and modeling, <a

and fun with the SOAP server. Enjoy!</p>
