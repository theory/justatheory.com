How the Bricolage Summer of Code Projects were Selected
meta-keywords: Bricolage, Google, Summer of Code, projects, winners, methodology

<p>As you may have <a href="/bricolage/summer_of_code_applications.html"
title="Bricolage Summer of Code Application Summary">read</a>, we got quite a
number of applications from students wishing to contribute to Bricolage as
part of Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html"
title="Google Summer of Code">Summer of Code</a> initiative. Quite a few of
them were very good. There were eight projects I wanted to accept, but,
Bricolage was allocated only four projects. Of course, this is four more than
we would have had otherwise, and I'm really excited to be working with them
this summer.</p>

<p>The four winning projects are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add Input Channels, by Marshall Roch</li>
  <li>New Sample Document types and templates, by Scott Loyd</li>
  <li>Port Bricolage to Apache 2/mod_perl 2 and Windows, by Sam Strasser</li>
  <li>Port Bricolage to MySQL, by Tamas Mezei</li>
</ul>

<p>The other projects I wanted to get but could not were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ad Bulk Edik, Bulk Media Upload, and Site Tags, by Andreas Hofmeister</li>
  <li>Element Occurrence Specification, by Christian James Muise</li>
  <li>Add JSP Templating, by Adrian Fernandez</li>
  <li>Update and Modernize the Installer, by Yiannis Valassakis</li>
</ul>

<p>I am hoping that some of these students might want to work on their
projects, anyway. I've even found other developers to help with the mentoring
of JSP templating (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~patl/" title="See Patrick
LeBoutillier's modules on CPAN">Patrick LeBoutillier</a> with Perl/Java voodo) and
the installer modernization (<a href="http://sam.tregar.com/" title="Sam
Tregar: Life">Sam Tregar</a>
of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/matchstick/" title="The Matcstick
SourceForge project page">Matchstick</a> fame). Unfortunately, I've not heard
back from any of them after sending them an invite to participate in the
project. C'est la vie, I guess</p>

<p>The hardest part of the proposal evaluation process was selecting from the
20 proposals to port Bricolage to MySQL. Ultimate, there were four excellent
proposals for this project. Reading the proposals over and over, I couldn't
decide between them. Ultimately, I sent an email to the four top contenders
with the following items for them to reply to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please describe in a line or two your Perl knowledge or experience (if any).</li>
  <li>Please describe in a line or two your MySQL and PostgreSQL knowledge or experience (if any).</li>
  <li>Please describe any previous Bricolage usage experience.</li>
  <li>Please describe any previous Bricolage development experience.</li>
  <li>Please describe any previous Open Source development experience.</li>
  <li>What school do you attend?</li>
  <li>What is your specialty at the school?</li>
  <li>How many years have you attended there?</li>
  <li>How much time do you expect to have for this project?</li>
  <li>Have you applied for any other Summer of Code projects?  If so, which ones?</li>
  <li>Your personal or professional web page URL (if any).</li>
  <li>Would you be willing to collaborate with another developer who might be working on a SQLite port to ensure that your changes can fully inter-operate?</li>
  <li>Please outline your project plan for porting Bricolage to MySQL, including a description of what parts of the Bricolage API, DDLs, installer, and upgrader would need to be modified to complete the project.</li>
</ol>

<p>For better or for worse, all four applicants responded with detailed answers to my questions. They were all great, and that made it even harder to select just one of them. At this point, there were only a few hours left to rank applicants in Google's SoC Admin Web app, so I figured I had to get more objective&#x2014;or at least fool myself into thinking I was.</p>

<p>So I decided to rank each applicant from one to five for each question, and
then add up all of the results and see who came out on top. So now I was
comparing answers to a single question between applicants, and filling in
scores for them in a spreadsheet. As it was, things were still really close; yes, all of the students where <em>that</em> good! Tamas came out on top with a score of 30, two others were tied at 28, and the fourth applicant scored 26. They were close enough that I wanted to review them all one more time, this time paying specific attention to the last item in my questionnaire, the project plan.</p>

<p>Each of the four applicants had taken the time to read the mail lists and had looked at the existing Bricolage code. But there were varying levels of detail and demonstration of knowledge for how to implement the MySQL port, but Tamas did come out slightly ahead on this item, so I gave his proposal the green light.</p>

<p>But in truth, I would have been happy with any one of those four applicants. I was only sorry I had to choose only one! If Google does this again, I think I'll list many more project ideas on the Bricolage Web site, and try to steer people to the mail lists to discuss their ideas before sending them in. Then I might end up with 11 great applications!</p>
