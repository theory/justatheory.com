<p>Following Lawrence Lessig's <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/002264.shtml" title="enblogment: For Kerry">lead</a>, I am pleased to <a href="http://pres2004.scripting.com/2004/10/29#a5" title="Endorse John Kerry">endorse</a> <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/" title="John Kerry for President">John Kerry</a> for President of the United States of America. In fact, like most Oregonians, I've already voted by mail. Have you?</p>

<p>I could say a lot of things about why I support Kerry. But what it really all comes down to is how incredibly well-qualified he is for the job. Looking back over the last few presidents, I think that he is perhaps the best qualified since Richard Nixon--and he comes without all of Nixon's problems. Ultimately, however, I couldn't make the argument better than it has already been made, ad nauseam. So I'll just point to the endorsements that make the case so powerfully that I feel that little more needs be said.</p>
