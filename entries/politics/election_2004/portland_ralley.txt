<p>Julie and I just got back from the Kerry rally at the Tom McCall Waterfront
Park in Portland, OR. According to the <a href="http://blog.johnkerry.com/" title="Kerry Blog">Kerry Blog</a>, there were ca. 60,000 people at the rally.
Julie and I waited till the last minute to go, and for a while there thought
we wouldn't get in. But we did, and heard the second half of Kerry's speech.
As we made our way through the city afterward, we overheard some other folks
saying they'd arrived at 8:30 and <em>never</em> got in. We felt very fortunate.
I think it was just dumb luck to have found the entrance we did.</p>

<p>We were pretty close to the stage, too. We were off to the right out of the
frame of this picture, but still only 30m or so from the stage. We could see
Kerry quite clearly from there. It was interesting to see him in person; he
was quite lively in addressing the crowd, and clearly engaged in what he was
doing. He seemed to be having a good time, too. But I couldn't help wondering
if he and the other speakers didn't occasionally feel silly up there, making
the same speech with the same gestures over and over. Especially at the end,
when Kerry shakes his fist in the air like a champion boxer and points out
various groups of people for him and Teresa to wave to. But then again, maybe
I'm just too jaded myself.</p>

<p>Still, it was interesting to be there in person and to see him working in
person. It gave me much more of the impression that we're dealing with a real
person here, rather than just a talking head like you might see on TV. Here's
a guy who might soon hold what is arguably the most powerful political office
in the world, and really, he's just a regular guy trying to do some good, out
there talking to anyone who will listen about how he wants to make things
different than they have been. He's a guy you could talk to, and talk to about
the issues.</p>

<p>I got this impression from a rally with 60,000 people? Yeah, maybe I'm just
nuts.</p>

<p>Highlight of the speech (what we heard of it) for Julie and me: Kerry's
plan to invest much more in alternative energy, to make America energy
independent by 2020. That's a plan I can very much get behind! I also
appreciated his saying that he would never send US troops into action unless
there was no alternative. The Iraq war is such a clusterfuck in so many ways;
I really hope that things will change when Kerry is sworn into office.</p>

<p>But even if they don't change that much, or not for a while, I would love
to be able to have complaints about the Presidential administration more like
I had about the Clinton White House. I'd rather be worried that my President
was too close to the middle and conciliatory than that he was so far to the
right as to be, well, radical.</p>

<p>I will do my part to see to it that Kerry gets the chance to disappoint me
as a highly preferable alternative to the current state of complete
mortification.</p>
