    <h1>Introduction to PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL</h1>

<p>One of the most powerful features of PostgreSQL is its support for
user-defined functions. These can be written in any number of programming
languages, including pure SQL, C, Perl, Python, and PHP, among others. Perhaps
the most common programming language for PostgreSQL functions, however, is
PL/pgSQL (don't ask me to pronounce it), since it comes with PostgreSQL and is
easy to set up.</p>

<p>Similar to Oracle's PL/SQL, PL/pgSQL is a procedural language that is much
more powerful than pure SQL, in that it supports variables, conditional
expressions, looping constructs, exceptions, and the like. And since it
natively supports all of PostgreSQL's SQL syntax, it may be considered a
superset of PostgreSQL SQL. It also respects all data types and their
associated functions and operators, and is completely safe for use inside of
the server. Get all of the details in
the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/plpgsql.html"
title="PL/pgSQL - SQL Procedural Language">PL/pgSQL documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Installing PL/pgSQL</h2>

<p>To get started with PL/pgSQL, you first need to make sure that it's
installed in your PostgreSQL database. If it was a part of the template1
database when your database was created, you'll already have it installed. To
see whether you have it, execute this query in the <em>psql</em> client:</p>

<pre>
SELECT true FROM pg_catalog.pg_language WHERE lanname = 'plpgsql';
</pre>

<p>If a row is displayed with the value <q>true,</q> then you already have
PL/pgSQL installed in your database. If it's not, then quit <em>psql</em> and
execute this command in a terminal session:</p>

<pre>
createlang plpgsql database_name
</pre>

<p>You must have superuser permission to the database in order to add a
language. If you've just installed PostgreSQL, then you can likely use the
default <q>postgres</q> user by passing <code>-U postgres</code>
to <em>createlang</em>. From here on in, you should be able to follow along by
pasting the sample functions into <em>psql</em>.</p>

<h2>A First Function</h2>

<p>So let's write our first PL/pgSQL function. We'll start with something
simple, a function to return
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" title="Wikipedia:
Fibonacci numbers">Fibonacci number</a> for a position in the Fibonacci
sequence. I know, I know, <em>everyone</em> uses a Fibonacci calculator to
demonstrate code. So why can't I be original? Because a couple iterations of
such a function will allow us to explore some of the more useful features of
PL/pgSQL. It's purely pedagogical. So here's a simple implementation:</p>

<table>
<tr><td><pre class="linenos">
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td>
<pre>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib (
    fib_for integer
) RETURNS integer AS $$
BEGIN
    IF fib_for &lt; 2 THEN
        RETURN fib_for;
    END IF;
    RETURN fib(fib_for - 2) + fib(fib_for - 1);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Using the function is simple:</p>

<pre>
try=% select fib(8);
 fib 
-----
  21
(1 row)
</pre>

<p>So let's look at the code line-by-line. The first line uses PostgreSQL's
<code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION</code> statement to create the function. The
name of the function is <code>fib</code>. The <code>CREATE OR REPLACE
FUNCTION</code> statement is more useful in practice than the simple
<code>CREATE FUNCTION</code> statement, since it will drop an existing
function with the same name and argument signature before creating the new
one, and this convenience is very useful while you're developing and testing a
new function.</p>

<p>The second line declares the integer variable <var>fib_for</var> as the
sole argument to be passed to the function, and thus constitutes its entire
argument signature. The argument signature must come after the name of the
function, inside parentheses. In this respect, it's not a lot different than
function or method declarations to be found in most programming languages.
Arguments can be of any type supported by PostgreSQL, including user-created
types and domains, as well as composite data types, such as table row types.
We'll just be using simple data types in this article, but see
the <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/plpgsql-declarations.html"
title="PL/pgSQL Declarations">PL/pgSQL Declarations documentation</a> for
details.</p>

<p>Note that named arguments were added to PL/pgSQL in PostgreSQL 8.0. In
earlier versions of PostgreSQL, you'd have to either use the default, numbered
variable names for the arguments, or declare aliases in a <code>DECLARE</code>
block, like so:</p>

<pre>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib ( integer ) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
  fib_for ALIAS FOR $1;
BEGIN
-- ...
</pre>

<p>But unless you have an older version of PostgreSQL, named arguments are the
recommended way to go—and they're more convenient, besides.</p>

<p>The third line closes out the argument signature and specifies the function
return value (<code>integer</code>). As with arguments, the return value of a
function can be any PostgreSQL data type, including a composite type or even a
cursor. The end of line three has the odd string <q>$$</q>. This is
PostgreSQL <q>dollar-quoting,</q> and when used in place of the usual
single-quotation mark quoting (<q>'</q>), single quotation marks within the
body of the function need not be escaped. This makes them much easier to
read.</p>

<p>Line four's <code>BEGIN</code> statement marks the start of the function
body, while lines 5-8 <em>are</em> the function body. Here we're just using
the standard recursive algorithm for determining a Fibonacci number. Lines 5-7
use the PL/pgSQL <code>IF…THEN</code> conditional statement to return the
sequence number itself if it is less than two. As with all blocks in PL/pgSQL,
the <code>IF…THEN</code> conditional ends with a final <code>END</code>
statement. Conditional expressions in PL/pgSQL can be any SQL expression that
you're accustomed to seeing in the <code>WHERE</code> clause of a typical
<code>SELECT</code> statement. The nice thing here, however, is that you can
use a variable—<var>fib_for</var> in this case—in the expression.</p>

<p>Line five demonstrates the ability of PL/pgSQL to not only execute other
PL/pgSQL functions, but to do so recursively. In this case,
the <code>fib()</code> function is called twice by the <code>fib()</code>
function itself in order to properly determine and return the Fibonacci
number. From these statements, you'll note that the
PL/pgSQL <code>RETURN</code> keyword can be used anywhere in a PL/pgSQL
function to terminate the execution of the function and return a value.</p>

<p>Line nine's <code>END</code> statement of course signals the end of the
function body, while line ten closes the dollar quoting and identifies the
function implementation language.</p>

<h3>A Note on Statement Termination</h3>

<p>At first glance, the placement of semicolons to terminate statements in the
example function might appear to be somewhat ad-hoc. I assure that it is not.
In PL/pgSQL, all blocks must terminate in a semicolon, as must all statements
within that block. The expression that initiates the block, however, such
as <code>BEGIN</code> on line 4 or <code>IF fib_for &lt; 2 THEN</code> on line
five, do <em>not</em> end with semicolons. Line six, as a complete statement
within the <code>IF…THEN</code> block, ends with a semicolon, as does the
statement on line eight.</p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest way to remember this rule is to think of statements as
requiring semicolons, and block initiation expressions as not being complete
statements. That is, blocks only become complete statements when they
<code>END</code>.</p>

<h2>Accessing Data</h2>

<p>As a recursive function, our <code>fib()</code> example is none too fast.
Of course it short-circuits when the argument is less than two, but otherwise
its use of recursion can be quite slow. Why? Because each time it is called,
many of the same numbers must be calculated and returned. On my PowerBook, for
example, when I want to find the 26th Fibonacci number, it takes nearly 3.8
seconds:</p>

<pre>
try=% explain analyze select fib(26);
                                        QUERY PLAN                                        
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Result  (cost=0.00..0.01 rows=1 width=0) (actual time=3772.062..3772.063 rows=1 loops=1)
 Total runtime: 3772.315 ms
(2 rows)
</pre>

<p>Why does it take so long? Because, like any recursive Fibonacci function,
it has to make 392,835 recursive calls to itself to calculate the 26th
Fibonacci number. Those recursive calls add up! Since the same arguments are
passed to the function so many times, and of course always to return the same
values, what would really improve the performance of the function is
to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization" title="Wikipedia:
Memoization">memoize</a> it. <dfn>Memoization</dfn> caches the results of a
function call for a given set of arguments so that, when the function is
called again with the same arguments, it can just return the value from the
cache without recalculating it—thus, in this case, minimizing the need for
recursion.</p>

<p>Now, PL/pgSQL itself has no ability to store data outside of a function,
but we <em>are</em> programming a database here. So let's take advantage of
it! The trick is to create a table to function as the cache, and then to
access it from the function. Our new function, <code>fib_cached()</code>, does
exactly that:</p>

<table>

CREATE TABLE fib_cache (
     num integer PRIMARY KEY,
     fib integer NOT NULL
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib_cached(
    fib_for integer
) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    ret integer;
BEGIN
    if fib_for &lt; 2 THEN
        RETURN fib_for;
    END IF;

    SELECT INTO ret fib
    FROM   fib_cache
    WHERE  num = fib_for;

    IF ret IS NULL THEN
        ret := fib_cached(fib_for - 2) + fib_cached(fib_for - 1);
        INSERT INTO fib_cache (num, fib)
        VALUES (fib_for, ret);
    END IF;
    RETURN ret;

END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Lines 1-4 create the table for caching the Fibonacci sequence. The
<var>num</var> column represents the sequence number for which the
corresponding Fibonacci number is stored in the <var>fib</var> column. We make
the <var>num</var> column a primary key since it should of course be
unique.</p>

<p>As you can see, the <code>fib_cached()</code> function defined from lines
6-28 introduces quite a bit more syntax. Looking it over, the first line with
something new is line five's <code>DECLARE</code> statement. As you may have
ascertained by the previous discussion of argument aliases, this statement
introduces a block for declaring variables for use in the function body. All
variables used in the function but not declared in the argument signature must
be declared here, and you can give them a preliminary assignment using the
PL/pgSQL assignment operator, <code>:=</code> (so named to avoid conflicts
with the SQL <code>=</code> comparison operator). Again, you can use any
PostgreSQL data type for your variables, but here we're again keeping things
quite simple: we've defined a single integer variable, <var>ret</var>, which
we'll use to keep track of a value to be returned by the function.</p>

<p>The <code>BEGIN</code> statement on line 11 ends the variable declaration
block and starts the function body. The next thing we see, at line 12, is the
familiar <code>IF…THEN</code> block that once again short-circuits the
function if the argument to the function (stored in <var>fib_for</var>) is
less than two. But then things get more interesting.</p>

<p>We've already seen in the <code>DECLARE</code> function how to assign a
value to a PL/pgSQL variable. But what if you want to assign a value from
a <code>SELECT</code> statement to a variable? Lines 16-18 demonstrate the
approach. A variation of the standard <code>SELECT INTO</code> statement
allows one to select values into one or more PL/pgSQL variables rather than
into a table. A comma-delimited list of variables follows the
<code>INTO</code> expression, while the rest of the statement remains a
normal <code>SELECT</code> statement. There are a couple of caveats to
<code>SELECT INTO</code> assignment, however: the <code>SELECT</code>
statement must return no more than one row, and the selected columns must
match the number and types of the variables.</p>

<p>Here it's relatively straight-forward. We just want to look in our cache
(the <var>fib_cache</var> table) to see if the Fibonacci number for the
sequence number <var>fib_for</var> has already been calculated and cached. So
the <code>SELECT</code> statement selects the <var>fib</var> column from
<var>fib_cached</var> where the number is <var>fib_for</var> and stores the
result in the <var>ret</var> variable.</p>

<p>Now, I said that the <code>SELECT INTO</code> statement can return no more
than one row, which also means that it can return no rows. If it does, then in
this function the value of <var>ret</var> will be <code>NULL</code>.
Accordingly, line 20 begins an <code>IF…THEN</code> block by checking to see
if the value of <var>ret</var> is indeed <code>NULL</code>. If it is, then we
know that the Fibonacci number needs to be calculated. Line 21 thus
recursively calls <code>fib_cached()</code> just as <code>fib()</code> used
recursion. Only instead of returning the value, we use the <code>:=</code>
assignment operator to store the value in <var>ret</var>.</p>

<p>And now that we have it, it needs to be inserted into the cache so that it
never has to be calculated again. Lines 22-23 do just that via a standard
SQL <code>INSERT</code> statement. The variables <var>fib_for</var> and
<var>ret</var> can be used right in the <code>INSERT</code> statement, just
as <var>fib_for</var> was used in the <code>SELECT</code> statement at lines
16-18. One of the great features of PL/pgSQL is that it precompiles SQL
statements embedded in it, and variables are used as if they were passed to a
prepared SQL statement as arguments for placeholders. In other words,
the <code>INSERT</code> statement magically becomes akin to:</p>

<pre>
PREPARE some_insert(integer, integer) AS
INSERT  INTO fib_cache (num, fib)
VALUES  ($1, $2);

EXECUTE some_insert(fib_for, ret);
</pre>

<p>The great thing about this feature of PL/pgSQL is that it makes embedded
SQL statements extremely fast. Fast because the precompiled query plan can
simply be reused for each call to the function (on a per-connection basis)
without recompiling and planning.</p>

<p>At any rate, line 25 returns the value of <var>ret</var>, regardless of
whether it was looked up in the cache table or calculated and then stored in
the cache. The result of adding the caching support makes the function far
faster, now:</p>

<pre>
try=% explain analyze select fib_cached(26);
                                      QUERY PLAN                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Result  (cost=0.00..0.01 rows=1 width=0) (actual time=50.837..50.838 rows=1 loops=1)
 Total runtime: 50.889 ms
(2 rows)

try=% explain analyze select fib_cached(26);
                                     QUERY PLAN                                     
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Result  (cost=0.00..0.01 rows=1 width=0) (actual time=2.197..2.198 rows=1 loops=1)
 Total runtime: 2.249 ms
(2 rows)
</pre>

<p>The first call to <code>fib_cached()</code> finds no cached values, and so
must create them all as it goes along. But this just means that it needs to
calculate the values for each number up to 26 once, so that recursion is
practically eliminated (indeed, <code>fib_cached()</code> is called
recursively only 24 times, once each for the numbers 2 through 26). The result
is a much faster query: only .05 seconds, as opposed to the nearly 3.8 seconds
we saw for <code>fib()</code>. Of course the second time we call
<code>fib_cached()</code>, it only needs to look up and return the 26th
Fibonacci number, since it was already cached by the first call, and so now
we're down to 0.0025 seconds. Not a bad improvement, eh?</p>

<h2>Loop Constructs</h2>

<p>Of course, memoization is not necessarily the best way to speed up a
function. Some languages provide memoization support natively or via
easily-added libraries, but PL/pgSQL offers no such facility. We therefore had
to add a fair bit of code in order to manually add memoization to the
function. So we end up with something fast, but somewhat more difficult to
maintain.</p>

<p>It turns out that there's another approach to determining the Fibonacci
number for a particular position in the sequence that involves neither recursion
nor memoization. All that we need to do is to execute a
loop <var>fib_for</var> number of times, and keep track of the calculation
each time through. So let's try it:</p>

<table>
<tr><td><pre class="linenos">
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
</pre></td><td>
<pre>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib_fast(
    fib_for integer
) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    ret integer := 0;
    nxt integer := 1;
    tmp integer;
BEGIN
    FOR num IN 1..fib_for LOOP
        tmp := ret;
        ret := nxt;
        nxt := tmp + nxt;
    END LOOP;

    RETURN ret;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<p>All should look familiar here up through line eight, but allow me to point
out how we've declared multiple variables in the <code>DECLARE</code> block
and assigned initial values to two of them. The new
variables, <var>nxt</var> and <var>tmp</var>, will be used to track the
Fibonacci numbers through each iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>And speaking of the loop, it begins on line nine. All loops in PL/pgSQL use
the <code>LOOP</code> keyword, and of course end with <code>END LOOP</code>. A
loop can begin with nothing more than <code>LOOP</code>, in which case it will
be an infinite loop (out of which one can break with the <code>EXIT</code>
keyword). Otherwise, there are a couple of different approaches to looping in
PL/pgSQL, including <code>WHILE</code> (such as <code>WHILE foo IS NULL
LOOP</code>) and <code>FOR</code>—the latter of which we have used here.</p>

<p>A <code>FOR</code> loop is the only context in PL/pgSQL where a variable
can be used without being predeclared in the <code>DECLARE</code> block. In
the form we've used here (there are other forms—for
<a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/plpgsql-control-structures.html#PLPGSQL-RECORDS-ITERATING"
title="PL/pgSQL: Looping Through Query Results">iterating over rows</a> in
a <code>SELECT</code> query, for example), we use the variable <var>num</var>,
which is automatically created as a read-only integer variable that exists
only in the scope of the loop, to loop <var>fib_for</var> times. We're not
actually using <var>num</var> in the loop in this example, but I thought you
should know that you could.</p>

<p>All that happens inside the loop is assignment. The <var>ret</var> variable is
once again used to keep track of our return value, while <var>tmp</var> and
<var>nxt</var> are used to track the previous and next values in the
sequence. That's it. Once the loop has run over all of its iterations, the
last value stored in <var>ret</var> is returned.</p>

<p>So how does the use of the loop affect performance?</p>

<pre>
try=% explain analyze select fib_fast(26);
                                     QUERY PLAN                                     
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Result  (cost=0.00..0.01 rows=1 width=0) (actual time=0.433..0.433 rows=1 loops=1)
 Total runtime: 0.485 ms
(2 rows)
</pre>

<p>So over four times faster than the cached version, mainly because there are
no longer any queries to an external table. It'll be even faster with lower
numbers and slower with higher numbers, as the <var>fib_for</var> argument
determines the number of iterations required. (Although any number over 45
won't work at all, because then the return values start too be too big for
PostgreSQL integers. If you need them that big, use <code>bigint</code>s,
instead.)</p>

<h2>Practical PL/pgSQL</h2>

<p>Of course these functions are not very practical, unless for some reason
you need to calculate Fibonacci numbers in your database, but they allowed us
to explore the basic syntax of PL/pgSQL as well as how it interacts with other
database objects such as tables. But the real advantages of PL/pgSQL shine
when it can be used to greatly simplify situations where client code must
typically make numerous database calls in order to satisfy a data pattern. In
the interests of illustrating such practical PL/pgSQL, my next article will
demonstrate how to write PL/pgSQL functions to simplify the management of
ordered many-to-many relationships.</p>
