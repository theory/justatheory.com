comment: I'm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to use the --to_regex_map option. I'm not a perl programmer. I've been reading the man pages for SVN::Notify and Getopt::Long, and I'm still confused about this section in the manpage.--to-regex-map translate@example.com=L18N. I don't know what the L18N is supposed to be. It says that it's be the key of some hash reference that gets passed in somehow.Here is what I want to do:Everything from this part of the repository  branches/testBranch should be sent to this email address. testing@example.com. It's not clear to me what I need to do, to accomplish this.
