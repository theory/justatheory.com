comment: <p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dbi-dev@perl.org/msg02352.html">This post</a> from Matt Sergeant firmed it up for me. Bricolage started out doing its own thing, before I'd heard of Apache::DBI. See <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dbi-dev@perl.org/msg02341.html">this post</a> in the same thread for when I was able to solve whatever problem I had using <code>connect_cached()</code>.</p><p>In short: <code>connect_cached()</code> is a better per-process caching algorithm than Apache::DBI.</p><p>â€”Theory</p>
