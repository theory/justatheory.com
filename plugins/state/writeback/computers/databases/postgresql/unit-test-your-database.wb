comment: <p>Nice going! I wasn't planning on viewing such an apparently long presentation but before I knew it I'd flipped through to the end. Solid work.</p><p>There seems to be a technical glitch in the upload such that every other slide is empty, btw.</p>

comment: <p>Yeah, SlideShare doesn't seem to understand the that things animate in automatically after the slide loads, I'm sorry to say. In the presentation, I switch to a slide, and the animcation appears after that. It'd be better if it loaded the slide without that transition, since it doesn't understand automatic transitions. But, frankly, given that I just uploaded a Keynote 2009, I'm pretty impressed with how well they did!</p><p>Thanks for the kind words; the talk seems to have gone over really well here, too.</p><p>—Theory</p>

comment: <p>I don't allow Flash to play in a web browser, and my link isn't fast enough to make it practical anyway. Slideshare insists on me having an account before I can download anything.</p><p>Can we have a direct URL to download the slides to view them at our leisure?</p>
