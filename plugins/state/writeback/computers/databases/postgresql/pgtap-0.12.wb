title: On Grammar
comment: <p>Thanks for your comments, Ben. I actually gave this a bit of thought, being something of a grammar pedant myself, and decided that benefits of the semantic the balance between â€œhasâ€ and â€œhasntâ€ outweighed any possible grammatical confusion. After all, the <code>has_</code> forms are quite natural (â€œI'm testing to make sure that this database <em>has</em> a certain tableâ€), and while it didn't occur to me until afterwards to add the negated versions, to me testing with â€œhasntâ€ is close enough (â€œI'm testing to make sure that this table <em>hasn't</em> a certain table). It's a bit archaic, perhaps, but it works.</p><p>That said, <code>has_no</code>isn't bad; I hadn't thought of it, though if I had, I might have rejected it anyway, as I do try to keep such things to the same numbers of words (i.e., the same number of underscores). <code>have</code>, on the other hand, doesn't really work. I <em>have,</em> but the database <em>has</em>. I'm testing the database, not myself.</p><p>That's my perspective, anyway. I wanted the negated functions to be easy to remember and nicely complementary, without being too long or too weird. I think that <code>has_</code> and <code>hasnt_</code> do the trick.</p><p>Thanks for the comments, though; I really appreciate it when other folks take the time to think about this stuff, too! It shows you care! :-)</p><p>â€”Theory</p>
