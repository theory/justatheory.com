title: TAP?
comment: I just followed a link from <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/perl/info/6p8tv/comments/">reddit</a>.  This page doesn't say what TAP is.  The only link for TAP goes to Technorati, where it appears that TAP is about tap dancing.  Your slides don't say what TAP is.  The <a href="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgtap/">project page</a> doesn't say what TAP is or have a link to TAP.<p>I'm guessing that it's the <a href="http://cpansearch.perl.org/~petdance/TAP-1.00/TAP.pm">Test Anything Protocal[sic]</a>.
