comment: <p>Hello.  As Depesz said, it is still not enough information to trace the performance issue (explain analyze, column type...).For now, what I can recommend is doing right side transformation before comparing and column redundace with the already calculated field using one index by that column.</p><p>instead of: <code>starts_at Between 'val1' and 'val2'</code>try: <code>starts_at between 'val1'::date and 'val2'::date</code>and make sure you have an index on that column only.</p><p>These are my two cents.</p>

comment: <p>So, if I understand righly, you must match the date part of the <code>events.starts_at</code> (stored as timestimes UTC) as seen by the client (i.e. non UTC) to a <code>recurrence_dates.date</code> (plain date).The convertion seems unavoidable, and, as you see, the performance must suffer (dont know if postgresql has some sort of function results cache).</p><p>My first simple hack (obvious and ugly, of course; redundant data...) would be to add a column to <code>events</code> table, <code>starts_at_local</code> = starts_at with the &quot;local&quot; (clientside) timestamp (or perhaps just the date part). It seems you really need that data and it's too costly to compute dynamically. If the view were used only ocassionally (say, for reports and/or in batch mode) you might even produce this column by <code>SELECT</code>ing <code>INTO</code> a temporary table, from the <code>events</code> table, perhaps restricting by date range.</p>

comment: <p>hernan,</p><p>Yes, that's a good point. By creating a <code>local_starts_at</code> in the <code>events</code> table and putting in a trigger to keep it up-to-date, I could indeed eliminate about half the calculations per row. That would be a bonus, but I'm hoping that it can be even better than that. And more normalized.</p><p>That said, I will likely do it if I can't figure out anything better. Or else create a trigger to create all of the recurrences of any event in a table and then just join on that. Only trouble there is if we add more dates to the <code>recurrence_dates</code> table in the future, we'd need to re-run the trigger for every row in the table in order to add the new recurrences. With the view, however, they're just there. It's a trade-off, and frankly, I'm not perfectly happy with either solution.</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion!</p><p>—Theory</p>

comment: <p>i think i have a solution for your problem.</p><p>if i might suggest - simply skip the <code>recurrence_dates</code> table, and use <code>generate_series</code> function. it will work much better.</p><p>if you have doubts about how to do it, please contact me on jabber (depesz[at]depesz.com) as i have some more questions about the case, but from what i see, it should be trivial <strong>and</strong> very fast solution.</p>

comment: <p>Hi depesz,</p><p>The reason we have a table of recurrence dates is that date math is complex. Daily events are simple, and weekly events not bad to calculate, but monthly and yearly events can be a PITA. For monthly events, if you make an event for Oct 31, there won't be one in November, because there is no November 31. For annual, if you make an event for February 29, 2008, there wont' be another one until 2012, because there wont' be another Feb 29 until then.</p><P>So I wrote a Perl script  that generates all the required dates for a length of time, and stores them in a table. Now if this could be replicated using <code>generate_series</code>, that would be great (our <code>recurrence_dates</code> table is huge). But I'm not at all clear on how it could be done. I'd more than welcome your suggestions; I've learned a lot from <a href="http://www.depesz.com/" title="&lt;/depesz&gt;">your blog</a> already, and am thrilled to learn more (PostgreSQL hacking being one of the things I really enjoy doing these days).</p><p>—Theory</p>
