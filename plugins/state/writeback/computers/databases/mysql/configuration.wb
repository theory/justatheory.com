comment: <p>Hi Conrad</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not a MySQL support site. So I have two suggestions:</p><ul><li>Make sure your MySQL server is actually up and running</li><li>If it is and you still get this error, ask for help in a MySQL support forum. There are helpful folks on #mysql on irc.freenode.net.</li></ul><p>â€”Theory</p>
