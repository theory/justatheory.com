titleSteve Jobs
body»B

Until a few weeks ago, the biography I read most recently was Dutch, Edmund Morris‚Äôs authorized portrait of Ronald Reagan. I read it not because I was interested in Reagan, but because Morris did something unique: he inserted himself into Reagan‚Äôs story as a (mostly) fictional character. Why would he do that? Morris grew up in Kenya, far from Reagan‚Äôs childhood in Illinois, not to mention years later. And yet there he was, a peripheral character throughout the story of Reagan‚Äôs life. What was the point?

Reading the book, the most striking thing about Reagan was how impenetrable he was. No one ever got through to him, to really know him. Perhaps it‚Äôs because there was no there there, or maybe there was an interesting person under the bland exterior he used to keep everyone out. It was impossible to know.

Such a personality must frustrate biographers. I want a deep understanding of the subject of a biography, to know what makes her tick, what her motivations and drives are. I want to get inside her head. But Morris couldn‚Äôt do that with Reagan. No one could.

I hypothesize that Morris stuck himself in the story, calling it a ‚ÄúMemoir of Ronald Reagan,‚Äù to contrast his subject with someone who‚Äôs head he could get into. And through that contrast, he drew out a little bit of something to demonstrate what made Reagan tick. Not a lot mind you, but it was an interesting attempt.

I thought about this as I read Steve Jobs, an authorized biography by Walter Isaacson. I‚Äôve been a fan of Apple‚Äôs products and vision for many years, but never delved deeply into the wealth of literature on Jobs himself or personal stories such as the birth of the Mac. My main exposure to Steve has been through his keynote presentations and various interviews and appearances over the years. I watch Apple relatively closely, but not Steve. In reading the biography, I wanted to get to know him, to get a feel for the man, and, above all, to find out what makes him tick.

Steve Jobs did give me a feel for the man. Many of the stories about his personality appear to be true. Steve Jobs was clearly a tyrant, but a tyrant with taste. I was struck by the constant theme that Jobs somehow believed that the usual rules don‚Äôt apply to him. At one point, pulled over for driving over 100 MPH, Jobs impatiently waits for the ticket, even demanding that the Chippy hurry up. Ticket at last in hand, he drives right up over 100 MPH again, despite a warning that he could lose his license.

Jobs‚Äôs famed reality distortion field let him pretend that rules didn‚Äôt apply to him, that the world was exactly what he imagined it to be. This ability had advantages (cajolling the CEO of  Corning to complete the ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù task to start producing huge volumes of Gorilla Glass virtually over night) and disadvantages (trying to cure his cancer with extreme diets).

It was that supreme confidence, combined with his taste, that shaped Jobs‚Äôs career and the success of Apple. When it comes to taste, Steve was continually, obsessively product-focused. The quality of the products had to be top notch. You get a feeling for this not so much in the successes of the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which are well-known, but on the things that shouldn‚Äôt matter. Deathly ill following his liver transplant, Jobs was still Jobs:

At one point the pulmonologist tried to put a mask over his face when he was deeply sedated. Jobs ripped it off and mumbled that he hated the design and refused to wear it. Though barely able to speak, he ordered them to bring five different options for the mask and he would pick a design he liked. The doctors looked at Powell, puzzled. She was finally able to distract him so they could put on the mask. He also hated the oxygen monitor they put on his finger. He told them it was ugly and too complex. He suggested ways it could be designed more simply. ‚ÄúHe was very attuned to every nuance of the environment and objects around him, and that drained him,‚Äù Powell recalled.

This is perhaps the most striking of many examples of Jobs‚Äôs obsession with quality and taste, and deftly captures the essence of it. I imagine Jobs thought about how to improve things in his life every second of his life. In his dreams, he might be improving the design of his pajamas or bedroom dresser.

The product obsession drives the book‚Äôs narrative, right down to its organization. A few chapters necessarily cover personal events, such as early years, love and marriage, and illness. More are organized around products. Relevant chapter titles:


4: Atari and India: Zen and the Art of Game Design
5: The Apple I: Turn On, Boot Up, Jack In‚Ä¶
6: The Apple II: Dawn of a New Age
8: Xerox and Lisa: Graphical User Interfaces
10: The Mac is Born: You Say You Want a Revolution
12: Design: Real Artists Simplify
13: Building the Mac: The Journey is the Reward
15: The Launch: A Dent in the Universe
18: NeXT: Prometheus Unbound
19: Pixar: Technology Meets Art
22: Toy Story: Buzz and Woody to the Rescue
27: The iMac: Hello (Again)
29: Apple Stores; Genius Bars and Sienna Sandstone
30: The Digital Hub: From iTunes to the iPod
31: The iTunes Store: I‚Äôm the Pied Piper
34: Twenty-first-century Macs: Setting Apple Apart
36: The iPhone: Three Revolutionary Products in One
38: The iPad: Into the Post-PC Era
40: To Infinity: The Cloud, the Spaceship, and Beyond



That‚Äôs nearly half of them, and all but a few of the others also include extensive discussion of products and design. Clearly Jobs was a man obsessed, that obsession shaped every facet of his life, and it therefore shaped the narrative of his biography.

But where does this come from? From whence derives the absolute faith in even the most most questionable ideas, the unwavering belief in his own infallibility, the near complete obsession with the design of everyday things? I see the ticks, but what makes him tick?

The truth is we don‚Äôt know. Isaacson doesn‚Äôt know. Sure, there are a few hypotheses about his adoption, about his parents insisting he was special. But I don‚Äôt know. Explaining Steve Jobs by his adoption seems like a cop-out. There are millions of adopted people, many with no doubt similar histories (educated biological parents, doting middle-class adoptive parents). But there‚Äôs only one Steve Jobs. Jobs himself didn‚Äôt buy it, saying he hardly thought about his adoption.

There is also discussion of his study of Zen Buddhism, and his love for simple, beautiful places like Kyoto and Kona Village. I‚Äôve studied a bit of Zen Buddhism and visited Kyoto and Kona Village too, and have a deep appreciation for the beauty of all three. But I‚Äôm no Steve Jobs. Perhaps Steve dove very deeply into Zen Buddhism, so that through years of study and practice he became who he was (though, let‚Äôs face it, his personality couldn‚Äôt be much less Zen). But if so, I think it gets short shrift in Isaacson‚Äôs telling.

Perhaps it‚Äôs unfair to demand so much of a biographer. I want to go into the head of his subject, on a quest for a deeper understanding of the essence of the person, and come away with a greater knowledge his humanity. Such was impossible for Morris to do with Reagan, and it‚Äôs not fair to expect more of Isaacson with Steve Jobs. Not only was Jobs a deeply complex man with an impenetrable presence (one wonders how well Laurene Powell really got to know him; I‚Äôd like to read her book), but, hey, how much can one understand anyone else? People have been trying for centuries to understand Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin (including Isaacson!), with, let‚Äôs face it, limited success. It‚Äôs rare that a biography becomes so completely deep and authoritative ‚Äî so true, the definitive telling ‚Äî that no more biographies follow. More often new folks come along, taking different tacks to understand the ticks. Perhaps the best sense we get of an elephant is through the descriptions of all the blind people feeling different parts of the elephant.



I think my favorite tidbit from the book is Jobs playing a rare bootleg CD with a dozen taped sessions of the Beatles ‚ÄúStrawberry Fields Forever,‚Äù a gift from Andy Hertzfeld. Listening to the CD with Isaacson, Jobs talks about how the Beatles kept iterating, kept improving the song, working on every aspect over a period of time, getting it ‚Äúcloser to perfect.‚Äù Then he says:

The way we build stuff at Apple is often this way. Even the number of models we‚Äôd make of a new notebook or iPod. We would start off with a version and then begin refining and refining, doing detailed models of the design, or the buttons, or how a function operates. It‚Äôs a lot of work, but in the end it just gets better, and soon its like, ‚ÄúWow, how did they do that?!? Where are the screws?‚Äù

So maybe it‚Äôs fair that the narrative is largely product-driven. Jobs talked often over the years about how important good products are to him, much more important than profit, and the book reinforces that. He lived and breathed taste and products, to the exclusion of all else, including, at times, his family and his health.

Perhaps, then, what made Jobs tick was the iPhone and the iPad, and the exultation of being a part of creating a truly inspiring product.

titleAn Incurious Biographer
bodyãDAfter posting my thoughts on the Isaacson Steve Jobs biography a couple weeks ago, I finally let myself check out some of the deeper pieces on the topic by folks I respect. John Siracusa‚Äôs take was particularly enlightening, as his familiarity with the existing sources empowers a deeply authoritative critique of the biography. But it‚Äôs John Gruber‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting Steve Jobs Wrong‚Äù that validates my general feeling of dissatisfaction with Isaacson‚Äôs biography. This bit nails it:


  Jobs understood technology but was not an engineer. He had profoundly exquisite taste but was not a designer. What it was that Jobs actually did is much of the mystery of his life and his work, and Isaacson, frustratingly, had seemingly little interest in that, or any recognition that there even was any sort of mystery as to just what Jobs‚Äôs gifts really were. 


Yes, exactly! Isaacson does not seem interested in what made Jobs tick; that‚Äôs a real shame for those of us who are. I was ready to cut Isaacson a bit of slack, as writing a biography is very difficult, and writing a definitive one damn near impossible. But since Gruber hits the same point I tried make, and Siracusa has pretty thoroughly decimated Isaacson‚Äôs authority, I‚Äôm now far less willing to do so. Isaacson just seems incurious about his subject, whereas the best biographers are obsessed. A lack of curiosity ought to disqualify one for the job.

As Siracusa says, Steve Jobs picked the wrong guy.

titleGood at Doing Things
bodyˇjTonight, I atteneded a
talk, Good at doing things: Montessori education and higher-order cognitive functions, about the
Montessori method of childhood education and its effects on neurological
development. If I wasn‚Äôt a convert to the Montessori method before, I am now.
Julie and I went to back to school night at Anna‚Äôs new school, Childpeace
Montessori the other night, and we were both jealous.
How we wish we could have had this kind of education! This talk really sealed
it in my mind. I can‚Äôt imagine that I'd want Anna to have any other education.

Anyway, I might write a bit more on this later, but for now, here are my notes
from the talk. Enjoy.

specialist, and pediatric neuropsychologist.

 What is a neuropsychologist?


Clinical psychology
Postdoctoral training in child brain development
Assessment of brain functioning
Children with development problems impacting brain development, learning, cognitive functioning, behavior
Consult to parents, educators, physicians
Research: attention, poverty, lead, genetic disorders
Train future neuropsychologists



 Brain Development


Brain that is myelinated is functional
Injured brains don‚Äôt develop well
Rats with non-stimulating environment have smaller brains with fewer connections and lower IQ.
Rats raised in stimulating environment are heavier and more complex
Emotional support, stimulation good for brain development



‚ÄúExperimental interactions with the environment.‚Äù Provided in unparalleled way
by Montessori education.

 What should school be for?

In, US, it‚Äôs about preparing students for multiple choice tests.

If ask students, they want:


Leave school confident, willing and able to take the initiative introducing change
Become independent
Develop character and personality
Have speakers about careers and ed topics
Know how to apply facts and techniques to new problems
Want to speak well
Have discussion lessons where can put forward own view
Learn about different sorts of jobs and careers
Encourage me to have opinions of my own
Help me understand implications and responsibilities of marriage



List of things from teachers is similar. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs pretty neat!‚Äù
Reinforced by multiple studies around the world.

 How Steve Discovered Montessori Education

BWCA Wildlife and nature preserve.
Beautiful place. There is a YMCA camp, Camp
Widjiwagan. Woman, Debra Sussex, Wilderness
photographer and tour leader. She got her start at Widjiwagan. A leadership
development camp for young people. People come from all over the state to
attend. She saw kids from every corner of the state.

Hughes was post-doc. Asked her, ‚ÄúWhere do the good kids come from?‚Äù She
thought for a minute. They come from a Montessori school in Minneapolis. How'd
she come up with that? What is it about them? She said:

You have to understand young people have heard instinct, and these young
people are preoccupied. And everyone at Widji is supposed to help out. Most of
the time, those adolescents have to be asked to do something, then remind,
then hassle, then hold them accountable. But the kids from the Montessori
school, ask them to do something, they'd d it, do it well, then embellish it."

These kinds have ability to look around, figure out what needs to be done, and
do it. They're good at doing things.

For so many adolescents, you're not good at doing anything unless you go to
Montessori. You have to:


Ask them to do something
Hassle them
Remind them
Hold them accountable



Then they do bare minimum. Montessori kids, however:


Ask them to do something
They do it
They do it well
Then they embellish it



Ultimately, what they do is:


Look around‚Ä¶
figure out what needs to be done‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶and do it



Key sentence: ‚ÄúThey're good at doing things.‚Äù

 A Montessori Parent

Hughes daugher, Isabel was born. [His daughter, gets choked up.] Isabel went
to Montessori, has been there since beginning. Almost 11. Couldn‚Äôt be happier
with her progress and experience of seeing a child discover herself.

So the Hughes family fell in love Montessori. 75% of children of his
Neuropsychology colleagues in department had kids in Montessori at one time or
another.

Montessori education is the embodiment of all I learned while studying for a
Ph.D. in Child Development.

‚ÄîFiona A., Ph.D.

That‚Äôs where my kid is going to school!

‚ÄîTerry H., Ph.D.

It‚Äôs like education designed by a gifted pediatric neuropsychologist.

‚ÄîSteve Hughes, Ph.D., pediatric neuropsychologist

It‚Äôs like education designed by a gifted developmental neuropsychologist.

‚ÄîFiona A., Ph.D., developmental neuropsychologist

What is it about Montessori that pediatric neuropsychologists like? gets them
worked up?

 Brain-based learning

Spent most of career figuring out what happens in the brain of children.
Montessori is the original Brain-based learning. Maria understood this before
anyone coined that phrase.

 About Brains

Some areas are responsible for certain functions. Motor and sensory areas are
bands that go over the brain. Mapping of functional areas finds that they're
not the same size as parts of the body for which they control function. From
brain‚Äôs point of view, body is huge hands, large face, not much of anything
else.

 Way of Thinking About Things Brains Do

Functions are in neurological ‚Äúnuggets.‚Äù Communicate with other areas through
neural networks. Brains need functioning nuggets and networks to work
properly.

What happens when you read:


Apprehend text
Decode text
Identify words
Apply vocabulary, reasoning, concept formation, general intelligence
Determine meaning



These are nuggets that must communicate in order to read properly.

Children with reading disorder have brains that don‚Äôt activate as much. Such
children‚Äôs functions can be improved. Have to do lots of calisthenics of brain
to develop those nuggets. It‚Äôs hard, and takes someone who knows what they're
doing.

 Reading


Letter/word recognition
Phonological processing
Language comprehension



Maria Montessori knew about these before the study. Stuff in Montessori
classroom covers all of these thing. For children with dyslexia, pediatric
neuropsychologists do exactly these things to help, e.g., sandpaper
letters.

Doing cylinder
work,
child learned perfect pencil grasp. Was easy to learn to hold the pencil when
started to write, because had already had practice with cylinder‚Äôs.

Child without grasp can still have phonological processing going on, doing
writing with movable
alphabet, phonetically. They
can write before they can form letter shapes or hold a pencil.

Word matching words to photos organized into categories, for language
comprehension. They learn not just objects and their words, but category-ness.
Brain is learning how to bring order to the world, create systems, and
organize them.

If you take nothing else home tonight, take this:

Healthy networks develop through experimental interactions with the
environment.

Children need ability to test the environment, make mistakes, test hypotheses,
see how things go together.

When brain runs into something new, it focuses all available neurons to figure
it out. Those with better networks are better at figuring things out. Better
networks lead to better, more accurate problem-solving. Need lots of
opportunities for exploration to develop these networks. Generalized
activation ‚Äî every available nerve is called upon to solve a new problem.
Once you understand problem, very little brain is required to solve it.
(Tetris example.) This is what learning is like.

 What should schools be for?

About building better brains by developing nuggets and networks!

This is what Montessori education is about. Teacher makes sure what child is
doing is just on the edge of what they've done before. Great to give to child
something, a task, that‚Äôs developmentally appropriate to them, so they are
challenged by it. There is no environment like a Montessori classroom to really
emphasize this. If there is something you're doing that‚Äôs developmentally
appropriate for you, every neuron is focused on the task.

What would it be like if we spent every day like this?

How else can we make brains better? Hands-on activity. Learning that things
have a beginning part, a middle part, and end end part. All meaningful
learning takes place through error and analysis. Don‚Äôt solve problems for the
child; let them figure it out.

How else can we make better brains? Multisensory work. Self-guided learning.
People learn better by doing the things they're interested in. Montessori
teacher knows there are things to discover, and helps the child to get the
tools to figure it out.

Other places to have experimental interactions with the environment? Sim
City! Get to analyze the problems of
city planning. Inventor of Sim City was Montessori educated, through 6th
grade, later realized it was the high point of his education. Started making
games, which he thinks of more as toys. Maria Montessori designed toys to
allow children to discover things on their own, rather than just be taught
them.

The games that I do I reall think of as modern Montessori toys, and I really
want them to be presented to kids in a way where kids can explore and
discover their own principals.

Will Wright at TED in
2007,
where he talks about his Montessori influence.

Most Important Part of Talk Starts Now

 Executive Functions

Hughes believes that the Montessori education provides environment that is
unique in providing extraordinary role of developing executive functions.

(From Q&A: Executive functions abilities are mostly genetic and possibly early
development environments. ‚ÄúPossibly‚Äù because these things are hard to measure
in children. If you check off the things you need, they're all in the
Montessori classroom, and Hughes believes that such an environment does
promote exectutive functions, he just hasn‚Äôt yet done the study to show such
conclusively.)

Prefrontal cortex modify remote events (through time and space) through
intentional behavior. Through its development, links the present to the
future. Once this developed in humans, Humans had won evolutionary contest.

Chimps can solve problems. But they can‚Äôt plan for the future. Can stack boxes
to get banana on ceiling, but can‚Äôt stock up boxes for when bananas reappear
next week.


Judgment
Planning 
Imagining
Foresight
Organizing
Self-awareness
Self-correction
Picking strategies
Monitoring progress
Sustain intention
Inhibit impulses



These are executive functions. This is what our prefrontal cortex does. When
this is developed, you are an effective human being.

Unlike with learning problems, there is little to do to develop executive
functions in later age. For the development in children, there is nothing like
Montessori classroom to develop executive functions. Those who don‚Äôt
develop them are simply not that good at doing things.

Normalization represents some aspect of executive functions. Working memory is
essential to executive planning. And in Montessori classrooms, they plan
learning games. These develop this. It‚Äôs deliberate. Need limitation of
materials so children have to learn to limit inappropriate behavior. So if
there is only one pink tower, child has to plan, inhibit impulses, etc., to
use it.

Only way to develop executive function skills is through experimentation with
environment.

 Normalization

Aspects that Maria wrote about:


Love of order
Love of work
Love of silence and being alone
Profound concentration‚ÄîThe core function behind effective behavior
Obedience
Independence and Initiative
Spontaneous self-discipline
Attachment to reality
Joy‚ÄîPromote self-esteem not through promoting narcissism, but through doing things!



 What School for Most Children is About

Remember the lists of what children and teachers consider important? Doing
well on standardized tests is not in the top 10. It‚Äôs #23, according to
teachers.

Those that receive the most attention int he classroom? #1; Helping students
do well on standardized tests!

And what are the successfully met goals? Helping students do well on
standardized tests is #1. Understand what is happening i the world is #10!

If education is always to be conceived along the same antiquated lines of a
mere transmission of knowledge, there is little to be hoped from it in the
bettering of man‚Äôs future.

‚ÄîMaria Montessori

Competent Vice Presidents tend to:


Show initiative
Set goals
Coach
Influence people and organizations
Build teams
Listen and demonstrate empathy
Control impulses
Help others analyze problems and develop strategies
Reward and recognize contributions



None of which is taught in business schools!

Find the same things for, e.g., competent machine operators:


Dependable
Accurate in reporting
Respond to the needs of the situation without needing instructions
Get along with others
Take responsibility



None of this stuff taught in vocational school.

The best teachers;


Recognize unique talents in each student
Create individualized education processes that foster each student‚Äôs unique abilities
Work with other teachers to understand of how growth is promoted
Help parents create developmental environments for their students at home
Analyze and harness sociological forces that control what happens in schools
Work toe change society for the benefit of children



These are the things that teachers who are nominated as extraordinary teachers
possess. None are taught in teachers colleges. These are learned only by
engaging and experimenting with the real world.

 What about the academic stuff?

Craig Public Montessori School in Milwaukee, covered in the journal Science.
by Dr. Angeline Lillard. At end of
kindergarten, Montessori children had superior:


Executive control
Decoding and early math
Understand the mind
Appeals to social justice
Social awareness



At end of grade six:


Social skills
Sense of community
Creativity in story creation
Complexity of sentence formulation



East Dallas Community School

Montessori-based, serves children from birth to 3rd grade in one of most
under-served communities in Dallas.


In 2002, 78% of third graders applied to gifted and talented program and all
were excepted.
Since 1978, 97% of third-graders go on to graduate high school or get a GED.
Of those, 88% go on to college.
In comparison, only 50% of students from same community but different
scheools graduate from high school.



 And How is Conventional Education Doing?

Hasn‚Äôt changed much in last 100 years.

Schools struggle to meet state marks. It‚Äôs in the news all the time. Saddest
part about it is that it‚Äôs no longer surprising.

It‚Äôs time to do something different! We've tried the existing approach, it
doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs not good for children. No reason schools have to be the way
they are. There is a better way. That‚Äôs what Montessori teachers provide.

 Three components of Classical Montessori Education

Culture (of respect for child)
Method
Curriculum and Materials

Everyone falls in love with materials, but the culture is most important. It‚Äôs
an exposure for children that‚Äôs transforming.

The social environment of a child influences the child, but also helps them
recover from trauma or disease. Humans are shaped by their social experiences.
We learn how to be humans from other humans. Children take what is given to
them by adults and their world and the convey them. Montessori provides
culture that‚Äôs supportive of what we identify as civilization. Civilization is
optional.

Whoever touches the life of a child touches the most sensitive point of a
whole which has roots inthe most distant pat and climbes toward the infinite
future.

‚ÄîMaria Montessori

In infancy, we believe parents can solve all our problems

As children, it‚Äôs that teachers can

As adults, it‚Äôs that governments.

It as never been more important to raise generations who:

Look around, figure out what needs to be done, and do it.

title"TV Providers Hate Their Customers
bodyßoI‚Äôve been using Comcast for Internet for several years, but we haven‚Äôt had any TV service at all since we cancelled DirecTV about 18 months ago. And thanks to iTunes, Netflix, thedailyshow.com, and colbertnation.com, and BitTorrent, we haven‚Äôt missed it one bit.

It has been our preference to download officially sanctioned TV shows and movies. But there are a number of really great shows shows for which the current season‚Äôs episodes aren‚Äôt readily available through sanctioned online channels. There are only three ways to get them, that I know of:


From a cable or satellite provider
BitTorrent
Wait for DVD/Netflix/iTunes releases



Yeah, that‚Äôs it. And it‚Äôs even worse if you don‚Äôt happen to live in the US. I‚Äôm grateful for thedailyshow.com and colbertnation.com, and shows that appear pretty quickly in iTunes, like Breaking Bad. But many quality shows do not. Of course there are services like HBO Go, but they‚Äôre only available to cable and satellite providers.

I don‚Äôt want to download such shows from BitTorrent; I want to make sure that the people who created them are well rewarded for quality programming. So if I want to see them now, that leaves me only one choice: subscribe to a cable service.

Into the Lair

A few weeks ago we did that. We added phone and TV (including HBO) to our Comcast service. The Internet service was the same as ever (pretty good), while the phone service is pretty transparent (and cheaper than Qwest). And that makes sense: These are just services for pushing bits around, not at all complicated.

The TV service was something else entirely.

Holy mother of hell is it terrible. We opted not to get a DVR; the pre-DVR technology is worse than you remember. But it‚Äôs not the technology that‚Äôs so awful, since we could always opt for a DVR or subscribe to TiVO. The real issues are:


The remote is impenetrably complicated; I don‚Äôt have any faith a DVR remote would be much better
The on-screen menus are miserable to navigate and read
I couldn‚Äôt find shit about what ‚Äúpackage‚Äù we had on the web site
Comcast.com thought we didn‚Äôt have HBO and so wouldn‚Äôt let us access HBO Go
There are 1000s of channels of shit
I called support, and before I gave up, at some point an ad for pay-per-view programming streamed into my auditory canal
Did I mention that there are 1000s of channels of shit programming?



Truly, the user experience is just terrible. Now, I know it can be better, because we had the old DirecTV TiVO, which worked pretty well. But even DirecTV doesn‚Äôt use TiVO anymore, and from what I understand, all other DVRs have a terrible interface.

And don‚Äôt get me started on the programming. Remind me again why I should pay for the privilege of getting horrible programming and atrocious ads pushed into my TV? Shouldn‚Äôt they pay me for that privilege?

I can only conclude that cable and satellite providers hate their customers. They get them to sign up for a plan to auto-pay $80 or $90 or $125 a month, and then they don‚Äôt have to care about what kind of service they provide. Interfaces don‚Äôt matter. Design doesn‚Äôt matter. Simplicity doesn‚Äôt matter. Complication matters.

I don‚Äôt want this. Why do I have to pay such a heavy price in terms of usability and quality just so I can pay for the shows I actually want to watch? I don‚Äôt want to give Comcast my money. I don‚Äôt want to give ‚ÄúReal Housewives of Miami‚Äù my money. I want to give Blown Deadline and HBO my money.

A Plea

Dear Distributors and Production Companies:

Please don‚Äôt make me pay the cable or satellite provider tax! Don‚Äôt make me pay for a bunch of crap I don‚Äôt like, and for a terrible user experience, just so you can get a small slice of it. Please, please, please let me pay you for your shows. Release them on iTunes. I‚Äôll pay. Release them on Netflix. I‚Äôll pay. Make them available outside the US, people will pay to be caught up on the great stuff everyone else is talking about on Facebook! Just let us find your shows easily and pay to download or stream high-quality videos to play on our computers and Apple TVs. (Bonus if I don‚Äôt have to deal with flash!).

If you make it easy for people to pay for great shows, we‚Äôll pay. Netflix now streams more content than BitTorrent because it‚Äôs easier to use: and people pay for that.

Back to Reality

After 2 weeks, we called Comcast and cancelled the TV service. We‚Äôre back to our original plan, minus BitTorrent. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll do:


If a show is available from Netflix, we‚Äôll get it there.
If a show is available for free on the web, like thedailyshow.com, we‚Äôll get it there
If a show is available from iTunes, we‚Äôll get it there
If a show is available on DVD, we‚Äôll order it from Netflix



And for shows that are not immediately available for the current season by any of these means, well, I guess we‚Äôll wait. I think most shows come out on iTunes or DVD after a year or so. We‚Äôll just deal with the lag. I wish it wasn‚Äôt there, but it is, and I‚Äôm no longer willing to dirty myself using a TV service.

title8What Works and What Doesn't in Online Wine Applications
bodyöyAlder Yarrow
posted an entry in
his Vinography about why the wine tasting sites, such
as Cork'd, LogABottle, Winelog.Net, TastyDrop,
and OpenBottles, will ultimately
fail. To summarize, his reasons boil down to these:


  There aren't enough wines in the databases
  Users don't know how to write
  There is no incentive to visit regularly
  There aren't enough wine lovers to reach critical mass


Now, I've given this topic some thought, in part because, for a while, I
was planning to write a Webapp to track wine cellar contents and write
reviews, myself. But I recently backburnered it, because of the launch of
Cork'd. And I think that, ultimately,
Cork'd will be a winner, though not necessarily in the way that Alder
thinks.

Alder assumes that all of these wine sites are trying to build a critical
mass of users and wine reviews to counter the influence of
the Park-tator. This is a laudable goal, but I agree likely to fail for
all the reasons he mentions. However, I don't think that this is Cork'd's
intent. And the reason Alder misses this point is because‚Äîto borrow terms
from Clay Shirky‚Äîhe's
still thinking in terms of Web School practices. Cork'd, on the other hand, is
Situated Software.

What do I mean by that? The intent of Cork'd is not to amass a huge
collection of wines or reviews, though that may end up being a significant
side-effect. Its intent is to allow users to make recommendations to their
friends. Cork'd lets you identify your drinking buddies as your
own small community within the larger Cork'd community, and then you can make
recommendations to your drinking buddies. The cool thing about this is that
you can ignore the crappy reviews from the people you don't know or trust, and
just collect recommendations from the people you do know and
trust.

So users will visit Cork'd because they want to know the preferences of the
people they trust, and will want to share their own recommendations with their
buddies. Creating personal relationships is a much more compelling reason to
return to the application than the old idea of building status among the entire
community. And with their emphasis on sharing with your friends, I don't think
that building a large corpus of content was even something that crossed the
designers' minds when they created Cork'd. They just wanted to have a way to
remember wines that they had recommended to each other, and to let other
people do the same.

So, in a sense, I think that Cork'd does address Alder's points,
if only by taking a completely different approach to the Online wine app.
Because it's not a site that's about reviewing wines, it's about sharing with
your friends. And as sites like Flickr and LiveJournal have shown, this is
where the action really is.

As a side note, I do think that Vinography's comments
about CellarTracker are spot on. It is a potentially
powerful resource, but its UI must be the single worst I've ever
seen. That was why I was thinking of writing my own Online Wine app,
to be able to keep track of my own cellar and to let others do the same, but
to make it a more enjoyable experience than one can currently get with
CellarTracker. I only wish that I'd thought of so many of the ideas in Cork'd
a year ago and made it happen, so that I could get the benefits of Cork'd
and track my own wines like I could with CellarTracker. But for now,
I'm just sending feature requests to Cork'd and watching to see how things
develop.

titleIs Printing Money Stimulative?
bodyª5Last week, my good friend Curtis ‚ÄúOvid‚Äù Poe posted a blog entry in which he suggested that the UK‚Äôs recent decision to print more money as a way of stimulating the economy is a fundamentally bad idea. While I personaly don‚Äôt know whether or not it is actually a bad idea, Ovid‚Äôs post didn‚Äôt convince me that it wasn‚Äôt, because, as I said in a comment, I‚Äôm quite certain that people spending more right now is a bloody good idea. So if printing more money gets people to spend more, then good, because that will encourage credit to start flowing again.

Ovid kindly took the time to leave me an extended reply, to which I wrote a rebuttal, which LiveJournal decided was too long and rejected. So I‚Äôm posting it here on my blog, instead. It‚Äôs an interesting discussion anyway, and so deservers higher visibility than a LiveJournal comment, I think.

So, on with my reply. Ovid, you wrote:

So the town council decides to print money money as a ‚Äústimulus‚Äù and give everyone an extra $10.

I note that in the original post, you did not say that the UK government would be giving everyone a check. You just said that that they were going to print more money. These are not the same things.

First, if things get really bad the people know that this might be a one-time deal, so they may simply hoard the money and not spend it, meaning that the council has wasted resources.

Although your example is overly simplistic (necessarily so, given this medium), I agree that just giving money to people may not stimulate the economy very well. This is why Bush‚Äôs ‚Äústimulus‚Äù failed last year: A lot of middle- and uppper-class families got checks for $600 per adult, and since these people weren‚Äôt having much trouble paying their bills, they just saved it. The Obama administration is trying to do it a bit differently by giving more money to poor people, who will have little choice but to spend it to alleviate debts and put food on the table, which is obviously more stimulative. Conservatives hate it, because such people don‚Äôt pay income taxes, but as they do pay payrol taxes, it‚Äôs the smart thing to do to help out responsible people in need and to stimulate the economy a bit at the same time.

So while I agree that saving a stimulus check is not stimulative, if you give the money to people who spend it, it will be more likely to be stimulative. I‚Äôve no idea how bad off the people are in your hypothetical small town of 100.

Further, many people, seeing that money is simply being printed, now realize that the value of their currency is diluted. Where there was once $2,000, there‚Äôs now $2,200, meaning that each dollar is now worth about .91 cents (particularly when you realize that money is a proxy for labor and the amount of labor is a constant at any point in time).

I think that you‚Äôre overestimating how much people pay attention to such things. In a town of 100 people, they may notice it, but in a country like the UK, most folks won‚Äôt know that more money has been printed, and even if they did, are unlikely to think that it dilutes the value of the money they have unless there is inflation. It‚Äôs inflation that people will notice ‚Äî how much their  money can buy ‚Äî not the quantity of pounds sterling in circulation.

But let‚Äôs say everyone has an extra $10 dollars from the council‚Äôs actions and rushes out to spend money on clothes. The two tailors now have to spin up production again, but there might be a high enough demand that they can‚Äôt supply everyone with new clothes because the tailors have limited supplies. They can try to ration the clothes to ‚Äúfirst come, first serve‚Äù, but in practice, this isn‚Äôt what happens in economies.

Leaving aside the fact that there will be 1000s of other ways for people to spend the money, you‚Äôre assuming that there is no inventory. But I think part of the problem with the current economic situation is that companies have inventory that they‚Äôre unable to move. If people start spending more money, some of the inventory can clear out, and this will have a ripple effect, too.

In reality, the tailors would simply charge more for their clothes because of the higher demand.

In your hypothetical small town, perhaps this is true. But I think that, macroeconomically speaking, if a company can‚Äôt keep up with demand, they‚Äôll be happy to have that problem. But again, I suspect that there are inventory build-up issues that would need to be alleviated, first.

Even if they didn‚Äôt want to, the people who want clothes first or want to ensure that they get any clothes due to limited supply (since more people are now demanding clothes) might offer more money, thus driving up prices again.

You‚Äôre assuming that the stimulutive effect of the one-time distribution of money would create greater demand than there was before the recession started, which is unlikely. Given that you think that people are more likely to hoard anyway, this example of going to the other extreme (the extra money causes huge demand, more than there was before) seems gratuitously extreme. Honestly, the problem with the current stimulus plans is that they are insufficiently stimulative; no one thinks that they will be too stimulative. Indeed, as Krugman writes, it is much more dangerous to understimulate than to overstimulate, given the current situation.

You can‚Äôt provide unlimited amounts of cloth, so the tailors offer more money to ensure that they‚Äôre the ones who can sell or, at the very least, that they‚Äôre the ones who get the cloth first. This is a bad economy so they want to sell while they can. This knock-on effect pushes prices up throughout the economy.

Who‚Äôs talking about unlimited amounts? The distribution in your example will have a limited stimulative effect, not unlimited. This could be a problem if the government gave everyone ¬£100M, but that wasn‚Äôt your example (or even remotely in the realm of possibility).

This is what printing money does.

You have not demonstrated that. You‚Äôve shown an example where distributing money to poeple is either insufficiently stimulative, because they hoard it, or far too stimulative, becase people suddenly demand virtually unlimited supplies of things. While the hoarding is more likely ‚Äî especially if you give the money to poeple who don‚Äôt need it ‚Äî the latter is a straw man.

Besides which, ‚Äúprinting money‚Äù != ‚Äúsending stimulous checks to people.‚Äù

What would have been better for the council is to start a jobs program.

Oh, I‚Äôm in complete agreement with you on that one. Creating jobs will be the single best way to stimulate the economy. No question. My point is just that, while I don‚Äôt know enough to say whether or not printing more money will or will not be problematic, you are not convincing me that it is problematic. You may well be right, but you‚Äôre not making a convincing case as far as I‚Äôm concerned.

Also, bear in mind that these are not normal times. Normal stimulative approaches, such as lowering interest rates, just are not feasible. So governments must find other ways to be stimulative. Jobs programs are the best approach, as long as they start to approach the scope of job loss due to the recession. But I‚Äôm not surprised that governments are looking for other ways to try to stimulate the economy, even those that normally are frowned upon, such as deficit spending. In Krugman‚Äôs words, the only way out of the current crisis is for the government to ‚Äúcredibly promise to be irresponsible.‚Äù

Update 2010-2-15: Krugman has blogged about this.

titleShould We Withdraw From Iraq?
body¥?Over the weekend, I finally got ‚Äôround to reading a New Yorker article that I'd had my eye on for a while. I'd seen it when the magazine arrived a few weeks ago, but then couldn't find it, and got distracted by articles in other issues in the meantime, till I finally located it and sat down and read it.

I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone who knows me that I think that the Iraq debacle has been just that. It's an unmitigated disaster. The lengths to which the current administration has gone to deny the truth, even to itself, have been stunning. This article covered the administration's resistance to the term insurgency:

‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt even want to say the ‚Äòi‚Äô word,‚Äù one officer in Iraq told me. ‚ÄúIt was the spectre of Vietnam. They did not want to say the ‚Äòinsurgency‚Äô word, because the next word you say is ‚Äòquagmire.‚Äô The next thing you say is ‚Äòthe only war America has lost.‚Äô And the next thing you conclude is that certain people‚Äôs vision of war is wrong.‚Äù

One might quibble about this, and disagree, and argue that it is not, in fact, an insurgency that has been challenging our troops in Iraq (never mind the brewing civil war!), but the truth is that those officers in the fields who have embraced the term have been able to catalyze real improvements in Iraq. Why? Because once you accept that you're dealing with an insurgency, it obviously makes sense to use principles of counterinsurgency in order to affect change.

Such is in fact the lesson of Tal Afar, a city in the northwestern desert of Iraq, a place that was being called the next Falluja when command of the city was taken over by Colonel H. R. McMaster, author of Dereliction of Duty. McMaster led the counterinsurgency effort Iraq by setting an example at Tal Afar. In the last year he has achieved some success at it--and I say some success because the nature of counterinsurgency effort is to be very gradual. It comes from slowly building up trust with the people with whom you work, including those tied to the insurgents:

The classic doctrine, which was developed by the British in Malaya in the nineteen-forties and fifties, says that counterinsurgency warfare is twenty per cent military and eighty per cent political. The focus of operations is on the civilian population: isolating residents from insurgents, providing security, building a police force, and allowing political and economic development to take place so that the government commands the allegiance of its citizens. A counterinsurgency strategy involves both offensive and defensive operations, but there is an emphasis on using the minimum amount of force necessary.

Thanks to McMaster's leadership, there is now a tenuous peace in Tal Afar, and things are developing, but it crucially relies on the presence of American military personnel to maintain order. Because without order, peace and justice are luxuries. So what does the military plan to do next at Tal Afar? McMaster and his units will be sent home, their tour of duty complete, and US responsibility in Tal Afar turned over to new troops who have no experience there. This is bound to be detrimental to the effort, as the counterinsurgency doctrine requires deep familiarity with disputing parties, and vice versa. Without trust, the whole thing falls apart, and trust takes a great deal of time and effort to develop.

All of this is a long way to getting to my point. Unlike most liberals, I think, I am quite certain that we should not be pushing so hard to get our troops out of Iraq now. The fact that the Administration--particularly Rumsfeld--is pushing so hard in that direction should give us pause.

I was deeply opposed to the war from the outset, and dubious as to our prospects for the occupation (especially given President Bush's outspoken opposition to nation building). I seriously expected this administration to fuck it up, and hoped that I was mistaken. I wish I had been wrong. But now that we've gone in there and made a horrible mess of things, we have a responsibility to make things right--or as right as we can. And only in the last six months have some folks with good heads on their shoulders started to make a difference there. When we invaded, we took on a huge responsibility, and abruptly leaving the country to disintegrate into civil war just as we're starting to make serious progress is abandoning that responsibility, not to mention the people we set about to make free.

And need I point out that it's in our best interests to make good on our promises in Iraq? If we leave, the country will dissolve into civil war. And if the lessons of Afghanistan tell us anything, it is that a country at civil war breeds terrorism. Iraq would be worse, because we're more directly to blame for the situation there. We made the country unstable, angered a lot of people, and now we're talking about getting out?

I think that that we need to enlist the help of our allies (those we have left), increase the allied presence in Iraq, train the people there in the principles of counterinsurgency, and make things right. Any other choice, as far as I can see, would be disaster.

I'm not the only one. I leave you with this last tidbit from the article (though you really should read the whole thing for yourself):

Kenneth Pollack, who served on the National Security Council under President Clinton‚Äîand whose book ‚ÄúThe Threatening Storm‚Äù made an influential case for the war in 2002‚Äîrecently led a small group at the Brookings Institution in writing a detailed report on a new strategy for Iraq. It calls for the Administration to shift the focus from the pursuit of insurgents in the Sunni heartland and, instead, to concentrate overstretched American and Iraqi forces in cities where the reconstruction effort is still somewhat popular‚Äîproviding security while allowing economic development to flourish. This strategy, known in counterinsurgency doctrine as the ‚Äúink spot‚Äù approach (because zones of security gradually spread out from population centers), has also been proposed by the military expert Andrew Krepinevich. It was put into practice in Tal Afar. Pollack‚Äôs proposal demands that, in spite of intense political pressures at home, there be no troop withdrawals anytime soon, since the total number of American and Iraqi forces is now only half of what experts say is required to secure the country. It also counts on a level of international help that the Bush Administration has never shown the ability, or the desire, to muster. In a sense, the report asks the country to offer the same commitment and imagination, to take the same risks and make the same sacrifices, as the soldiers in Tal Afar.

titleReframing the Debate
body¨jIn light of the election results, I've been reflecting on what needs to happen next. I started by thinking about how I'd like to reclaim the word liberal for use by the left in general, and Democrats in particular. Hendrik Hertzberg said something interesting about this on Fresh Air back in July:


  Terry Gross: How do you think the word liberal has changed in meaning?

  Hertzberg: It has been diabolized by the right, unfortunately. It's a wonderful, perfectly good word. It's rooted in liberty. It has changed so much that if you go back to 1952, when Richard Nixon gave his acceptance speech at the Republican convention, when he was nominated for Vice President, the whole beginning of his speech was an argument that the Republicans--that he, Nixon, and Eisenhower, the Republicans--were the real liberals. In those days, liberal was a word that everybody wanted to have attached to him, and even Robert Taft would pay homage to that word. I think it was a mistake for liberals to let go of that word. I think it's a much better word than, say, the word progressive, because liberty is a better value than progress in my book.


Remembering this discussion, I started thinking about how we might reclaim the word, and this led me to ponder on how the right, starting with Reagan, turned it into a bad word. How did they do it? Well, they changed it from an adjective (the liberal candidate) to a noun (he's a liberal). They managed this by applying adjectives to the adjective (but not in the adverbial sense), so we got card-carrying liberal, tax and spend liberal, and so on. Perhaps, I thought, we just need to apply different adjectives to it in our day-to-day usage, such as freedom-loving liberal.

But that's not too strong, is it? Perhaps we could instead borrow the right's idea of recasting a common word with a negative connotation. Maybe we could start applying adjectives to other adjectives, such as conservative.

I started pondering on what it means to be conservative. It used to be that conservatives had a core set of values that were primarily focused on reducing the size of government. To do so, they wanted to lower taxes in order force lower spending on programs. But it was also important to them to keep the budget balanced. Tax cuts had to come hand-in-hand with reduced spending, because otherwise budget shortfalls would just pass debt on to our children, who would then have to pay more taxes. And in the meantime, the size of government would not actually be reduced.

This changed, as near as I can tell, during the Reagan administration. Here was a conservative president who, for the first time, cut taxes but increased spending. Spending on defense and weapons research shot way up in order to beat the Soviet Union in the so-called arms race. Whether or not the arms race was a justifiable policy in our attempt to win the cold war, when it was accompanied by tax cuts, it gave rise to a new type of conservative, the slash and burn conservative.

And George W. Bush is the biggest slash and burn conservative of them all. Even as he slashed taxes on the richest 1% of the population, he burned through the $237 billion budget surplus (projected by the Congressional Budget Office to accumulate to $5.6 trillion between 2002 and 2011) in near record time, and added to it the current $477 billion budget deficit (expected to accumulate to $5.2 trillion over the next ten years). Ten trillion dollar is a lot, but a slash and burn conservative always believes that there's money to burn.

Where did this budget shortfall come from? After all, tax breaks alone won't lead to a deficit when you have the kind of surplus we were expecting in 2000. How has President Bush burned through so much cash in such a short time? Well, it seems that he's a slash and spend conservative. He found new programs to spend the (nonexistent) money on, such as an incredibly expensive war in Iraq. Indeed, if Bush is the first CEO President, as he likes to style himself, then he must be of the Ken Lay Ilk: he's the Enron president!

I mentioned some of these ideas to Nat yesterday, and before I could get them out, fully formed, he pointed me to a new book from George Lakoff entitled, Don't think of an Elephant. Salon has a good article describing the book, and it does seem that Lakoff (whose work, I was amused to realize, I read in college when I was getting my MA in Anthropology) is arguing the same thing as I, only with robust tie-in to how people think and process information.

It's all about reframing the debate, to borrow Lakoff's terminology. The right has been so good at making a self-contained argument into a single catch-phrase--such as Clear Skies, Healthy Trees, partial-birth abortion, and death tax--that makes it easy for people to digest, so that they feel that they understand an issue just from the turn of phrase. We in the left need to follow suit, to find the self contained arguments in the clever turn of phrase. I'm going to do some more thinking on this, to find other ways to reframe the debate.

For too long, the right has defined the terms of the debate, and as the left has responded to them, they have lost, because you can't refute them. We need to reframe the debate by defining the terms and forcing the right to respond to those terms. The only way this can be done is if we use a few really good ones for core issues, and get them into widespread use, repeated over and over, for the next four years. We need a daily talking points memo to outline the discourse and organize the left, to get us all on message, so that people get the message.

Think you're tired of the phrase flip-flopper? Get ready to hear more about our slash and spend president. Ad nauseam.

titlePortland Kerry Rally
bodyñ

Julie and I just got back from the Kerry rally at the Tom McCall Waterfront
Park in Portland, OR. According to the Kerry Blog, there were ca. 60,000 people at the rally.
Julie and I waited till the last minute to go, and for a while there thought
we wouldn't get in. But we did, and heard the second half of Kerry's speech.
As we made our way through the city afterward, we overheard some other folks
saying they'd arrived at 8:30 and never got in. We felt very fortunate.
I think it was just dumb luck to have found the entrance we did.

We were pretty close to the stage, too. We were off to the right out of the
frame of this picture, but still only 30m or so from the stage. We could see
Kerry quite clearly from there. It was interesting to see him in person; he
was quite lively in addressing the crowd, and clearly engaged in what he was
doing. He seemed to be having a good time, too. But I couldn't help wondering
if he and the other speakers didn't occasionally feel silly up there, making
the same speech with the same gestures over and over. Especially at the end,
when Kerry shakes his fist in the air like a champion boxer and points out
various groups of people for him and Teresa to wave to. But then again, maybe
I'm just too jaded myself.

Still, it was interesting to be there in person and to see him working in
person. It gave me much more of the impression that we're dealing with a real
person here, rather than just a talking head like you might see on TV. Here's
a guy who might soon hold what is arguably the most powerful political office
in the world, and really, he's just a regular guy trying to do some good, out
there talking to anyone who will listen about how he wants to make things
different than they have been. He's a guy you could talk to, and talk to about
the issues.

I got this impression from a rally with 60,000 people? Yeah, maybe I'm just
nuts.

Highlight of the speech (what we heard of it) for Julie and me: Kerry's
plan to invest much more in alternative energy, to make America energy
independent by 2020. That's a plan I can very much get behind! I also
appreciated his saying that he would never send US troops into action unless
there was no alternative. The Iraq war is such a clusterfuck in so many ways;
I really hope that things will change when Kerry is sworn into office.

But even if they don't change that much, or not for a while, I would love
to be able to have complaints about the Presidential administration more like
I had about the Clinton White House. I'd rather be worried that my President
was too close to the middle and conciliatory than that he was so far to the
right as to be, well, radical.

I will do my part to see to it that Kerry gets the chance to disappoint me
as a highly preferable alternative to the current state of complete
mortification.

title!Howard Fineman's <q>Analysis</q>
bodyè4My father-in-law, Steven, sent me this link to a Newsweek column by Howard Fineman. Like Steven, I thought it very interesting that a conservative columnist would be basically saying that the election is all but over for Bush, given the past week's news. But the funny thing is, I didn't know that Fineman was conservative until I read that column. What gave it away?

It was this snippet:


  On one level, Kerry's position is a contradictory bundle of confusion. He says the war was a mistake, but he's the guy calling for a gung-ho strategy in Fallujah to root out terrorist nests. As the president has pointed out, Kerry is claiming he can win the support of allies even as he dismisses the contributions of existing ones and calls the entire war a diversion--and even as France and Germany already have said that they aren't going to rally to our side if Kerry wins. But if the situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate, Kerry's vision--or lack of it--matters less.


This seems typical of conservative commentary--it's a very selective description of Kerry's position. Yes, Kerry says that the war was a mistake, but now that we're in it, we need to do it right, including getting tough on rooting out the terrorists (who, by the way, only came into the country after the war started). Kerry has not dismissed the contributions of existing allies, but has pointed out that, unlike Desert Storm, this coalition is far from evenly divided. As Edwards repeatedly said during the Veep debate, the US bears 90% of the cost among the coalition members, both in terms of dollars and in terms of lives. There is no contradiction in these statements. The contradiction only comes up if they're used selectively and outside of appropriate contexts.

I am so sick of this hypocrisy! I keep telling people, I can't wait to be disappointed in Kerry's presidency, as I was with Clinton's. I'll take disappointment over being offended by the President and his apologists any day!

We just hosted our first MoveOn.org voter registration party. (You are registered to
vote, aren't you? If not, register register here.) Julie did all the hard work of
organizing the party, preparing the munchies, going through MoveOn's rather
overwhelming and confusing instructions to make things simple for the rest of
us, and getting the lists of unregistered voters to call. She's great at the
organizational stuff, and that the party was a success is due to her hard
work.

We had 10 participants, and each of us called 24-36 people, mainly women in
Florida who didn't vote in the last presidential election. We registered three
voters. Yes, only three! Most of the phone numbers we called were disconnected
or wrong numbers. We left messages on several answering machines. And when we
did get through to people, we often got replies such as:


  Click.
  I'm not interested.
  I don't believe that my vote counts for anything.
  I don't believe that women should be allowed to vote. [Yes, a woman said that.]
  Please don't call again.
  I'm registered. I vote. I always vote!


Rather incredible, really. So how was it a success, you ask? Well, MoveOn
ran out of numbers for us to call. After we went through all the numbers we
had, they had no more to offer. Over 15,000 people signed up to participate in
today's event. Probably more actually participated, since we, at least, had
2-3 people participate who hadn't signed up. And we did manage to register a
few voters, and leave messages on answering machines telling folks to visit
the MoveOn PAC Web site or their local department of motor vehicles to
register. We'll know for sure what happened when MoveOn reports the results in
the next few days, but if we managed to register only 5,000 voters, it could
make a difference in the outcome in November. And that's what we're really
hoping to achieve.

bodyÖyFollowing Lawrence Lessig's lead, I am pleased to endorse John Kerry for President of the United States of America. In fact, like most Oregonians, I've already voted by mail. Have you?

I could say a lot of things about why I support Kerry. But what it really all comes down to is how incredibly well-qualified he is for the job. Looking back over the last few presidents, I think that he is perhaps the best qualified since Richard Nixon--and he comes without all of Nixon's problems. Ultimately, however, I couldn't make the argument better than it has already been made, ad nauseum. So I'll just point to the endorsements that make the case so powerfully that I feel that little more needs be said.

titleenblogment: For Obama
bodyïFollowing up on my enblogment of Kerry four years ago, and with a tip of the hat to Lawrence Lessig, I am thrilled to endorse Barack Obama for President of the United States of America. I voted last night (gotta love Oregon vote by mail!).

The single best thing you can read for reasons why I endorse Obama is The New Yorker's endorsement. But in case you're not an elitist liberal like me, perhaps the endorsement of one of these other fine sources might help to sway you:
  

  The Washington Post
    The Los Angeles Times
    The New York Daily News
    The Miami Herald
    The San Francisco Chronicle
    Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
    The Philadelphia Inquirer
    The Chicago Sun-Times
    The Chicago Tribune
    The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
    The Denver Post


Personally, I believe that Barack Obama has the steady hand and unflappable personality to be able with withstand the worst that the next four years will throw at him. And, should he win, there will be a lot of shit to deal with, from accusations of stealing the election to confrontations with belligerent foreign heads of state. In the debates he was cool and composed, completely unfazed by McCain's bellicosity, and that composure will serve him extremely well as President, both in his role in the bully pulpit and in dealing with attacks from within and without. I don't agree with him on every detail of his policies, and I expect to, in some ways, be disappointed. But I'll take disagreement and disappointment over the sheer abhorrence of the last eight years any time. 

As for McCain, well, I was never a supporter, never even interested in him as a candidate. He was kind of interesting to people I respected in 2000, but that's about the best I can say about him. What I find bizarre is the two reactions to the McCain campaign that seem to be coming from McCain apologists in the punditry and the press. On the one hand, there are those who think that McCain is in some kind of bubble, unaware of how nasty his own campaign has become. On the other hand, there are those who think that McCain knows exactly what he's doing with the direction of the campaign. All I can say is, regardless of which of these is true (or some combination therein), is this really the sort of person you want to lead the United States of America? Someone who is either so out of touch that he has no idea what his staff is up to, or who is so obsessed with his immediate goals that he's willing to drag his entire operation to the most debased of levels? Neither represents leadership qualities. All I can say is, ‚ÄúNo thanks.‚Äù

Barack Obama for President. He's the right man for the job at the right time.

title$Five Things You Don't Know About Me
bodyæHThe reason it has taken me so long to write this entry, after Adrian tagged me back in February, is that I was waiting for a bit of news to become public so that I could talk about it. Of course, I didn't really have time to make it public, so that took too long, too. But it finally happened, as you'll see in Number 5.

1. I Lived on a Kibbutz
From August 1988 until March 1989, I lived as a volunteer at Kibbutz Dafna in Galilee Elian (upper Gallilee). This was one of the most memorable experiences of my life, and I've actually been meaning to blog about it for a while now. I arrived at the Kibbutz with only a few bucks in my pocket, but with a note saying that I'd been accepted as a volunteer. I moved into a small room in Death Row with another American who's name I've long since forgotten.

Within a few weeks, I'd been selected by the barman, Johnny Howarth, to be his co-barman (not what I was called, but that's memory for you). We ran a small bar just for the volunteers and interested Kibbutzniks in a small bomb shelter just across the roads from Death Row. Yes, really. We served Goldstar beer very cheaply (The kibbutz got it wholesale and we charged slightly more just to drink for free ourselves) and really bad vodka and rum to the few who wanted it. Most of the volunteers were English or Scandinavian, with a sprinkle of Americans and other sorts thrown in (we also had 10 Thais living with us for several weeks), and nearly all of us were 18-28 year-olds who liked to drink as much as possible and get laid. I wasn't quite the hero that Chad was in my brief time running an establishment, but, ah, what a life!
  
About the same time I started tending bar, I also got a larger room that for all but three months I had all to myself. For those three months, I shared it with an Aussie, Andrew Jeffreys, with whom I became very good friends. He later (1990ish) came and stayed with me at my Mom's house in Sacramento for several months.

I spent my time on the Kibbutz driving a tractor (only one volunteer got this honor‚Äîmost worked in the boot factory), mopping the dining room floor with the giant electric mop, getting drunk, and dancing the night away every Friday night at the Kibbutz disco (later named Domino). Great life for a 19 year-old taking a year off from college. I was even adopted by a Kibbutz family, visiting with their two young boys, who were very big on Michael Jordan (hi Esti!).

I finally came home in the Spring of 1989 after a short tour of Egypt and upon hearing that my mom was very ill (she's fine now, thanks). It was a good time to go, anyway, because I rather felt that my brain was beginning to rot. There is not a lot of intellectual stimulation in a Kibbutz environment. Still, it was an amazing time for me.

2. I Used to be an Archaeologist

Before I was an √ºber geek open-source and Web app hacker, I was an 
Archaeologist. The summer before I went to Dafna, I worked for six weeks at Tel Dor on the coast of Israel as a volunteer. I loved doing archaeology. So much so that when I finally returned from Israel and sobered up enough, I went back to school with a vengeance, earning my BA in Anthropology from the California State University, Sacramento. In 1994, I started the graduate program at the University of Virginia, intending to earn by Ph.D in anthropological archaeology. I participated in excavations in Israel (three more seasons at Tel Dor‚ÄîI met my [now] wife, Julie, there in 1992), Cyprus, and southeastern Turkey (Kurdistan, essentially).

I really enjoyed graduate school. Reading journals and writing essays really appealed to me, and the vigor of the debate in a graduate seminar full of smart people was absolutely invigorating. I finished my three years of course work, picking up my MA after two, and continued auditing graduate seminars a fourth year, just for the hell of it (I particularly enjoyed The Anthropology of Science and the archaeological theory seminars).

But as I started casting about for a dissertation topic, I could find nothing that really appealed to me. What I really enjoyed was debate and theory (hence my nickname and the title of this blog), and counting bone fragments the size of my toenail just didn't do it for me. I was a theorist among a gang of Michigan-trained empiricists. And I agreed with them that I needed to do something real on which to build my career. But frankly, the problem was that such things just did not interest me.

The summer following my fourth year, I accompanied my advisor, Pati Wattenmaker, to Kazane H√∂y√ºk, outside of Sanliurfa, in southeastern Turnky. At that time, I already had a job for the University's medical center doing integration programming in Perl, and was getting my first experience with databases (Access and SQL Server). Going into the project, I suspected that I was done with archaeology, but the fact that, after we came in from the field each day (I have always enjoyed the excavation part of archaeology), I found much more pleasure in creating an Access database for the tracking of vast quantities of data than I did in plowing through, categorizing, and entering in that data (read: counting pottery sherds).

So in the fall of 1998, I left the program ABD, and in the summer of 1999, Julie and I moved back to San Francisco.

3. Portland

Julie and I moved from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, in 2004. Of course many of you already know that, but do you know why?

The reason is that we were looking for a change of lifestyle. We loved our SoMa loft in San Francisco, but not the neighborhood so much. There are only so many times we could tolerate coming home to find that someone had pissed on our garage door. And don't even get me started on hypodermic needles. Julie and I wanted to start a family, and much as we loved our home and lifestyle in San Francisco, we knew it wasn't right for bringing up a child.

In truth, we had thought about Portland since 1996, when I was still in grad school, and we even visited for a few days. When we visited again in December of 2003, we had a real estate agent show us some homes, just to get a feel for the neighborhoods and what not, with the idea of maybe moving to Portland in a few years. But she showed us a house that we fell in love with, we mad an offer, and the rest is history.

Which leads me to‚Ä¶

4. Anna
  

  
Just a few months after our move to Portland, Julie got pregnant, and our daughter, Anna was born on May 13, 2005. She's nearly two now, and she's the light of our life. What a joy this kid is! She's smart, has a great sense of humor (yes, an 18-month-old can be funny!), and keeps us on our toes. I couldn't be happier; we lucked out and got a real gem of a daughter. We expect to have fun with her for the rest of our lives.

5. Values of n

Here's the big, recent change: I now spend my days as a Ruby hacker for Values of n, working with my friend Rael Dornfest building Stikkit and, more recently, i want sandy. Kineticode is still around, accepting only Bricolage support contracts‚Äîno more consulting. I remain the maintainer for Bricolage, but I've thrown down the gauntlet to get other people to step up an start to drive the project more.

So, Ruby, eh? And Ruby on Rails? Yes. Rael chose to use these technologies before I started working with him, and they were the right choices. And have I found the Ruby religion? Well, no, not really. There are quite a number of things I like better than in Perl, but none better than what will be in Perl 6 (someday, sigh). What I miss most from Perl are sane Unicode support, fantastic regular expression support, and lists (yes, lists‚Äîas opposed to arrays).

And what of Ruby on Rails, you ask? It seems like a fine Web application development environment. The controllers and views are nice. But I'll say no more. You'll have to buy me an awful lot of beer for that. I'll take Goldstar.

I now tag:

title&The 411 Since Graduating from College
body§eI recently got back in touch with a friend from college via Facebook. She asked me, ‚ÄúSo David give me the 411?  Whats been up with you for oh? 15 years?‚Äù Facebook‚Äôs Wall doesn‚Äôt seem to care much for multi-paragraph posts, but it kind of makes sense to post it in my blog anyway.

Julie and I moved to Florida in January, 1994 for a few months, and to Virginia the following summer. I started in the graduate program in the UVa Department of Anthropology in the fall. I also got on the internet that year and started learning how to program. We got married in May, 1995, in Orange, Virginia.

Two years later, I got my MA. Even though I was at UVa doing Near Eastern archaeology, by masters paper was based on research in the American Southwest. That‚Äôs just the way things shook out. The paper was later rejected by an archaeology journal. The peer reviews were really offensive, one in particular; some of the old guard of Southwest archaeology were really threatened by it. Didn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôd dropped the research part of the article before submitting. I was advised to do so, but it was clearly a mistake. C‚Äôet la vie. I mostly found it humorous and typical that academics could be such dicks to a student submitting his first peer-reviewed paper.

I have a PDF of the paper I keep meaning to blog. I should do that one of these days.

I spent a summer on Cyprus excavating a medieval site and the summer of 98 with my advisor for four weeks in southeastern Turkey. Kurdistan, really. My focus was supposedly architecture and urbanization, but in truth I enjoyed creating a database app for the project much more than counting pottery sherds. I went into the Turkey trip thinking it would determine whether or not I stuck to archaeology. I‚Äôd by this time had a full-time job for about a year doing systems and integration programming for the UVa medical center. It was fun, engaging work, and although I enjoyed the academic side of graduate schools (seminars and such), the culture of academia held no interest for me at all.

So I quit the program when I got back from Turkey. In 1999 we moved back to SF. I worked for UCSF for 9 months, then went to work for Salon.com. I was there a year, then went on my own, working on an open-source content management system called Bricolage that I‚Äôd developed with my colleagues at Salon. Life was great for us in SF. We moved into a loft in 2002 and really made the best of our time in The City.

In 2003 we were visiting Portland for a weekend just after Christmas and decided to have a real estate agent show us some properties to get a feel for the place. We‚Äôd been thinking about moving to Portland since ‚Äô96, and were still thinking maybe we‚Äôd do it in a couple more years. Julie‚Äôs dad had moved to Eugene, 2 hours down the road, so that was also a factor. To our surprise, we found a house we fell in love with. So we bought it, sold the loft, and moved to Portland, arriving in April, 2004. Our daughter, Anna, was born in May 2005.

And the rest is history. I‚Äôve done a bunch of technology-related work over the last 10 years, mostly Perl and PostgreSQL programming. These days, I do PostgreSQL consulting as an associate in PostgreSQL Experts, some Bricolage consulting via my company, Kineticode, and have recently started a new venture with a friend to develop iPad app.

Portland is a terrific place to live. We love it here. Not gritty like SF, but still with the elements of urban living. We have a house close to downtown and I get around mainly by bike. Anna is doing great; she‚Äôs so awesome. She‚Äôs in a Montessori school that we‚Äôll likely keep her in through 8th grade.

Julie is doing well, too. At UVa she became Art Director for the University‚Äôs Capital Campaign, and started a business, Strongrrl, while in San Francisco, mainly focused on graphic design for universities and non-profits. Business has slowed in the last few years, alas, as print has been dying and budgets have become restricted. She still does a bit of work, but also has started sewing and an Etsy store (kind of empty at the moment, will be stocked in the next couple of weeks) and this year doing deep genealogical research. We both work at home, but she does the lion‚Äôs share of the domestic and child-rearing duties. After 18 years together our relationship has deepened tremendously. We‚Äôre very happy together.

Anyway, life is good. I suppose if I were to write this again tomorrow I‚Äôd focus on a bunch of other things. A lot happens in 17 years, as you no doubt know. This is just a thin slice, with more academic stuff than I usually go into, but the context seemed to warrant it.

So what‚Äôs your 411?

bodyöSince June, as part of my work for PGX, I‚Äôve been doing on-site full-time consulting for iovation here in Portland. iovation is in the business of deterring online fraud via device identification and reputation. Given the nature of that business, a whole lot of data arrives every day, and I‚Äôve been developing PostgreSQL-based solutions to help get a handle on it. The work has been truly engaging, and a whole hell of a lot of fun. And there are some really great, very smart people at iovation, whom I very much like and respect.



So much so, in fact, that I decided to accept their offer of a full time position as ‚ÄúSenior Data Architect.‚Äù I started on Monday.

I know, crazy, right? They‚Äôve actually been talking me up about it for a long time. In our initial contact close to two years ago, as I sought to land them as a PGX client, they told me they wanted to hire someone, and was I interested. I said ‚Äúno.‚Äù I said ‚Äúno‚Äù through four months of contracting this summer and fall, until one day last month I said to myself, ‚Äúwait, why don‚Äôt I want this job?‚Äù  I had been on automatic, habitually insisting I wasn‚Äôt interested in a W2 position. And with good reason. Aside from 15 months as CTO at values of n (during which time I worked relatively independently anyway), I‚Äôve been an independent consultant since I founded Kineticode in November of 2001. Yeah. Ten Years.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, those ten years have been great! Not only have I been able to support myself doing the things I love‚Äîand learned a ton in the process‚Äîbut I‚Äôve managed to write a lot of great code. Hell, I will be continuing as an associate with PGX, though with greatly reduced responsibilities. And someday I may go indy again. But in the meantime, the challenges, opportunities, and culture at iovation are just too good to pass up. I‚Äôm loving the work I‚Äôm doing there, and expect to learn a lot over the next few years.



So what, you might ask, does this mean for Kineticode, the company I founded to offer support, consulting, and training services for Bricolage CMS? The truth is that Kineticode has only a few technical support customers left; virtually all of my work for the last two years has been through PGX. So I‚Äôve decided to shut Kineticode down. I‚Äôm shifting the Bricolage tech support offerings over to PGX and having Kineticode‚Äôs customers move there as their contacts come up for renewal. They can expect the same great service as always. Better even, as there are 10 associates in PGX, and, lately, only me at Kineticode. Since Kineticode itself is losing its Raison d‚Äô√™tre, it‚Äôs going away.



I intend to remain involved in the various open-source projects I work on. I still function as the benevolent dictator of Bricolage CMS, though other folks have stepped up their involvement quite a lot in the last few years. And I expect to keep improving PGXN and DesignScene as time allows (I‚Äôve actually been putting some effort into both in the last few weeks; watch for PGXN and Lunar/Theory announcements in the coming weeks and months!). And, in fact, I expect that a fair amount of the work I do at iovation will lead to blog posts, conference presentations, and more open-source code.

This is going to be a blast. Interested in a front-row seat? Follow me on Twitter.

Yes indeed, I am back. Was I ever gone? Well, yes, I've been rather busy
for the last 15 months.

But December 31 was my last day at Values of n. I'm really pleased with the
work I did there. Sandy in particular, was a pleasure to work with. I really
think that the work that Rael and I did with Sandy has been important work.
Dare I say potentially paradigm-shifting? At any rate, I'm convinced that
Sandy is really going to go places. If you haven't signed on to become her
client, do try. Though I will no longer be as intimate with her as I have in
the past, we're still going to keep in touch‚ÄîI'm still her client. And Rael
will do a great job pushing forward with her.

So why did I leave? Well, the truth is that, after
Julie's dad died in July, I found that I no longer had
the resources to commit to the 80-100 hours/week required to work in a
startup. It was just no longer that important to me. Don't get me wrong, it
was rewarding work, but my priorities completely realigned. It was vital that
I continue helping Rael to get Sandy's career launched, but once that was
done, it was time for me to move on.

And what am I doing now? Well, first and foremost, I'm taking a few months
off. I'm going to spend a lot more time re-aquainting myself with the two
terrific women with whom I share a house, and just generally reset myself.
Take a few deep breaths. Relax and enjoy life a bit. Sleep in now and then.
That sort of thing.

That's not to say that I'll be sitting on my ass all the time. I have a
very long list of things I want to do during this time, including catch up on
my blogging (hence the title of this post), fix some bugs in Bricolage and
help get 2.0 out the door, update my Perl libraries (I've got some great ideas
for improving SVN::Notify), finally get all my digital photos organized, etc. I
already spent much of last week revamping our mail system (I outsourced it
to FuseMail). And all that's leaving aside all the things Julie and I
want to get done around the house. That's the really important
stuff.

But do watch for more blog posts in the coming months, too. There are a few
interesting things I want to write about, and I've got some serious
catching-up to do. Interested in following along on my
adventures? Follow

bodyã So I'm a total math n00b, but I wanted to know how much of a change there was between some benchmarking numbers, in percentages. I thought that this was really basic, but I was wrong. So I Googled and found an article describing how to calculate the percentage change between two values. I wrote this Perl script so that I'd just have it in my toolbox:


#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

use strict;

print "\nUsage: $0 from to\n" unless @ARGV == 2;

my ($from, $to) = @ARGV;
my $diff = (($to - $from) / $from) * 100;
my $label = $diff < 0 ? 'greater' : 'less';
printf "$from is %.2f%% $label than $to\n", abs $diff;


When I run this script, I get values that agree with Dr Math's answers:


% percent_diff 7 5
7 is 28.57% larger than 5
% percent_diff 5 7
5 is 40.00% smaller than 7


So far so good. But then when I ran it on my benchmark numbers, I got different numbers than I would intuitively expect:


% percent_diff 13.67 40.73
13.67 is 197.95% smaller than 40.73
% percent_diff 40.73 13.67
40.73 is 66.44% greater than 13.67


Now, to me, it seems like you can fit roughly three 13.67s in 40.73. So then why isn't it 300% smaller?

Pardon my total ignorance, but if anyone knows the answer to this question, I'd greatly appreciate a simple explanation. Thanks!

Update:Mark Jason Dominus was kind enough to respond very lucidly to an email linking to this blog entry. With his permissin, I've pasted his comments below. All is now clear.

title1How Does One Protect Online Ballot Box Stuffing?
bodyãoI need to set up an online voting system. It needs to be more robust than a simple polling system, in order, primarily, to prevent ballot box stuffing. Of course I realize that it's impossible to prevent ballot box stuffing by a determined individual, but what I want to prevent is scripted attacks and denial of service attacks. The features I've come up with so far to prevent attacks are:


  Require site registration. You must be a registered user of the site in order to vote in an election, and of course, you can vote only once.
  Ignore votes when cookies are disabled, although make it look like a successful submission.
  Update result statistics periodically, rather than after every vote. This will make it difficult for an exploiter to tell if his votes are being counted.
  Use a CAPTCHA to prevent scripted voting.
  Send a new digest hidden in every request that must be sent back and checked against a server-side session in order to prevent curl attacks.
  Log IP addresses for all votes. These can be checked later if ballot box stuffing is suspected (though we'll have to ignore it if many users are behind a proxy server).


Of course someone behind a well-known proxy server who wants to repeatedly create a new user account using different email addresses and deleting his cookies before every vote could do some ballot box stuffing, but I think that the above features will minimize the risk. But I'm sure I'm forgetting things. What other steps should I take?

Leave a comment to let me know.

titleGit-R-Done
bodyôJust a quick followup on the completion of
the Bricolage Git migration last week, today I
completed writing up a set
of GitHub wiki documents explaining to my
fellow Bricoleurs how to start hacking. The most important bits are:


  Working with Git, explaining how to get set up with a forked Bricolage repository
  Contributing a Bug Fix, an intro to the Git way of doing things (as far as I understand it)
  Working with Branches, describing how to track a maintenance branch in your fork
  Merging with Git, to cover the frequent merging from Bricolage maintenance branches into master, and how to get said merges pushed upstream
  Starting a Project Branch, which you'd need to read if you were taking on a major development task, such as a Summer of Code project
  Contributing via Email, for those who don't want a GitHub account (needs fleshing out)
  Creating a Release, in which the fine art of branching, tagging, and releasing is covered


If you're familiar with the ‚ÄúGit way,‚Äù I would greatly appreciate your feedback on these documents. Corrections and comments would be greatly appreciated.

I also just wanted to say that the process of reconstructing the merge
history from CVS and Subversion was quite an eye-opener for me. Not because it
was difficult (it was) and required a number of hacks (it did), but because it
highlighted just how much better a fit Git is for the way in which we do Open
Source software development. Hell, probably closed-source, too, for that
matter. I no longer will have to think about what revisions to include in a
merge, or create a branch just to ‚Äútag‚Äù a merge. Hell, I'll probably be doing
merges a hell of a lot more often, just because it's so easy, the history
remains intact, and everything just stays more up-to-date and closely
integrated.

But I also really appreciate the project-based emphasis of Git. A
Subversion repository, I now realize, is really very much like a versioned
file system. That means where things go is completely ad-hoc, or
convention-driven at best. And god forbid if you decide to change the
convention and move stuff around! It's just so much more sane to get
a project repository, with all of the history, branches, tags, merges, and
everything else, all in one package. It's more portable, it's a hell of a lot
faster (ever tried to check out a Subversion repository with 80 tags?), and
just tighter. it encourages modularization, which can only be good.
I'll tell you, I expect to have some frustrations and challenges as I learn
more about using Git, but I'm already very much happier with the overall
philosophy.

Enough evangelizing. As a last statement on this, I've uploaded the Perl
scripts I wrote to do this migration, just in case someone else finds them
useful:


  bric_cvs_to_git migrated a CVS backup to Git.
  bric_to_git migrated Subversion from r5517 to Git.
  stitch stitched the CVS-migrated Git repository into the Subversion-migrated Git repository for a final product.


It turned out that there were a
few files
lost in the conversion, which I didn't notice until after all was said and
done, but overall I'm very happy. My thanks again
to Ask and the denizens of #git for all
the help.

title&Migrating Bricolage Subversion to Git
bodyŸ2Following up on last
week's post on migrating the old Bricolage SourceForge CVS
repository to Git, here are my notes on migrating the
current Bricolage Subversion repository to Git.

It turns out that migrating from Subversion is much more of a pain than
migrating from CVS. Why? Because CVS has real tags, while Subversion does not.
So while git-svn tries to identify all of your tags and branches,
it's really relying on your Subversion repository using standard directories
for all of your branches and tags. And while we've used a standard
for branches
directory, our tags
setup is a bit more complicated.

The problem was that we used tags every time we merged between branches.
This meant that we ended up with a lot of tags with names like
‚Äúmerge_rev_1_10_5665‚Äù to indicate a merge from the ‚Äúrev_1_10‚Äù branch into
trunk at r5665. Plus we had tags for releases.
So Marshall took
it upon himself to reorganize the tags in the Subversion tree so that all
release tags went into the ‚Äúreleases‚Äù subdirectory, and merges went into
subdirectories named for the branch from which the merge derived. Those
subdirectories went into the ‚Äúmerges‚Äù subdirectory. We ended up with a
directory structure organized like this:


/tags/
  /releases/
    /1.10.1/
    /1.10.2/
    /1.10.3/
  /merges/
    /dev_ajax/
      /trunk-7890
    /rev_1_10/
      /trunk-7043/
      /trunk-7194/
      /trunk-7300/


This was useful for keeping things organized in Subversion, so that we
could easily find a tag for a previous merge in order to determine the
revisions to specify for a new merge. But because older tags were moved from
previous locations, and because newer tags were in subdirectories of the
‚Äútags‚Äù directory, git-svn did not identify them as tags. Well,
that's not really fair. It did identify earlier tags, before they
were moved, but all the other tags were not found. Instead I ended up with
tags in Git named tags/releases and tags/merges,
which was useless. But even if all of our tags had been identified as tags,
none had parent commit IDs, so there was no place to see where they actually
came from.

So to rebuild the commit, release, and merge history from Subversion, I
first created a local copy of the subversion repository
using svnsync. Then I cloned it to Git like so:


SVNREPO=file:///Users/david/svn_bricolage_cc
git svn init $SVNREPO --stdlayout
git config svn.authorsfile /Users/david/bric_authors.txt
git svn fetch --no-follow-parent --revision 5517:HEAD


By starting with r5517, which was the first real commit to Subversion, I
avoided the git-svn error
I reported
last week. In truth, though, I ended up running this clone many, many
times. The first few times, I ran it with --no-metadata,
as recommended
in various HOWTOs. But then I kept getting errors such as:


git svn log
fatal: bad default revision 'refs/remotes/git-svn'
----------------------------------------------------


This was more than a little annoying, and it took me a day or so to realize
that this was because I had been using --no-metadata. Once I
killed off that option, things worked much better

Furthermore, by starting at r5517 and passing the
--no-follow-parent option, git-svn ran much more
quickly. Rather than taking 30 hours to get all revisions including stuff that
had been moved around (and then failing), it now took around 90 minutes to do
the export. Much more manageable, although I also started making backup copies
and restoring from them as I experimented with fixing branches and tags.
Ultimately, I ended up also passing the --ignore-paths option, to
exclude various branches that were never really used or that I had already
fetched in their entirety from CVS:


git svn fetch --no-follow-parent --revision 5517:HEAD \
--ignore-paths '(David|Kineticode|Release_|dev_(callback|(media_)?templates)|rev_1_([024]|[68]_temp)|tags/(Dev-|Release_|Start|help|mark|rel_1_([24567]|8_0)|rev_1_([26]|8_merge-2004-05-04)))|tmp'
svn2git --no-clone


The call to svn2git converts remote branches to local tags
and branches. Now I had a reasonably clean copy of the repository (aside from
the 120 or so commits from when Marshall did the tags reorganization) for me
to work with. I opened it up with GitX and
started scripting out merges.

To assist in this, I took a hint from Ask
Bj√∏rn Hansen, sent in email in response to a Tweet, and tagged every
single commit with its corresponding Subversion revision number, like so (in
Perl):


for my $c (`git rev-list --all --date-order --timestamp | sort -n | awk '{print \$2}'`) {
    chomp $c;
    my ($svnid) = `git show -s $c | tail -1` =~ /[@](\d+)\s+/;
    system qw(git tag -f), $svnid, $c;
}


The nice thing about this is that it made it easy for me to scan through
the commits in GitX and see where things were. It also meant that I could
reference these tags when I wrote the code to manage the merges. So what I did
was sort the commits in reverse chronological order, and then search for those
with the word ‚Äúmerge‚Äù in their subjects. When one was clearly for a merge (as
opposed to simply using the word ‚Äúmerge‚Äù), I would disable the search, scroll
through the commits until I found the selected commit, and then look for
a likely prior commit that it merged from.

This was a bit of pain in the ass, because, unfortunately, GitX doesn't
keep the selected commit record in the middle of the screen when you cancel
the search. Mail.app does this right: If I do a search, select a message, then
cancel the search, the selected message is still in the middle of the screen.
But with GitX, as I said, I have to scroll to find it. This wasn't going to
scale very well. So what I did instead was search for ‚Äúmerge‚Äù, then I took a
screen shot of the results and cancelled the merge. Then I just opened the
screenshot in Preview, looked at the records there, then found them in GitX.
This made things go quite a bit faster.



As a result, I added a migration function to properly tag merges. It looked
like this:


sub graft_merges {
    print "Grafting merges\n";
    # Handle the merges.
    for my $graft (
        [qw( trunk@5524   rev_1_8@5523 )],
        [qw( trunk@5614   rev_1_8@5613 )],
        [qw( rev_1_8@5591 trunk@5590   )],
    ) {
        my ($commit, $parent) = map { s/.+[@]//; $_ } @$graft;
        my $cmd = "\$(git rev-parse $commit) "
                . "\$(git rev-parse $commit^) "
                . "\$(git rev-parse $parent)";
        `echo "$cmd" >> .git/info/grafts`;
    }
}


By referencing revision tags explicitly, I was able to just use git rev-parse
to look up SHA1 hash IDs to put into
.git/info/grafts. This saved me the headache of dealing with very
long IDs, but also allowed me to easily keep track of revision numbers and
branches (the branch information is actually superfluous here, but I kept it
for my sanity). So, basically, for [qw( trunk@5524 rev_1_8@5523
)], it ends up writing the SHA1 hashes for r5524, the existing parent
commit for r5524 (that's the $commit^ bit), and for the new
parent, r5523. I ended up with 73 merges that needed to be properly
recorded.

With the merges done, I next dove into branches. For some
reason, git-svn failed to identify a parent commit
for any branch. Maybe because I started with r5517? I have no idea.
So I had to search through the commits to see when branches were started. I
mainly did this by looking at the branches
in ViewVC. By clicking each one, I was able to see the
earliest commit, which usually had a name like ‚ÄúCreated a branch for my SoC
project.‚Äù I would then look up that commit in ViewVC, such
as r7423,
which started the ‚Äúdev_ajax‚Äù branch, just to make sure that it was copied from
trunk. Then I simply went into GitX, found r7423, then looked back to the last
commit to trunk before r7423. That was the parent of the branch. With such
data, I was able to write a function like this:


sub graft_branches {
    print "Grafting branches\n";
    for my $graft (
        [qw( dev_ajax@7423            trunk@7301 )],
        [qw( dev_mysql@7424           trunk@7301 )],
        [qw( dev_elem_occurrence@7427 trunk@7301 )],
    ) {
        my ($commit, $parent) = map { s/.+[@]//; $_ } @$graft;
        my $cmd = "\$(git rev-parse $commit) "
                . "\$(git rev-parse $parent)";
        `echo "$cmd" >> .git/info/grafts`;
    }
}


Here I only needed to look up the revision and its parent and write it
to .git/info/grafts. Then all of my branches had parents. Or
nearly all of them; those that were also in the old CVS repository will have
to wait until the two are stitched together to find their parents.

Next I needed to get releases properly tagged. This was not unlike the
merge tag work: I just had to find the proper revision and tag it. This time,
I looked through the commits in GitX for those with ‚Äútag for‚Äù in their
subjects because, conveniently, I nearly always used this phrase in a release
tag, as in ‚ÄúTag for the 1.8.11 release of Bricolage.‚Äù Then I just looked back
from the tag commit to find the commit copied to the tag, and that
commit would be tagged with the release tag. The function to create the tags
looked like this:


sub tag_releases {
    print "Tagging releases\n";
    for my $spec (
        [ 'rev_1_8@5726' => 'v1.8.1'  ],
        [ 'rev_1_8@5922' => 'v1.8.2'  ],
        [ 'rev_1_8@6073' => 'v1.8.3'  ],
    ) {
        my ($where, $tag) = @{$spec};
        my ($branch, $rev) = split /[@]/, $where;
        my $tag_date = `git show --pretty=format:%cd -s $rev`;
        chomp $tag_date;
        local $ENV{GIT_COMMITTER_DATE} = $tag_date;
        system qw(git tag -fa), $tag, '-m', "Tag for $tag release of Bricolage.", $rev;
    }
}


I am again indebted to Ask for the
code here, especially to set the date for the tag.

Since I had created new release tags and recreated the merge history in
Git, I no longer needed the old tags from Subversion, so next I rewrote
the --ignore-paths option to exclude all of the tags directories,
as well as some branches that were never used:


SVNREPO=file:///Users/david/svn_bricolage_cc
git svn init $SVNREPO --stdlayout
git config svn.authorsfile /Users/david/bric_authors.txt
git svn fetch --no-follow-parent --revision 5517:HEAD
git svn fetch --no-follow-parent --revision 5517:HEAD \
--ignore-paths '(David|Kineticode|Release_|dev_(callback|(media_)?templates)|rev_1_([024]|[68]_temp)|tags/)|tmp';


With this in hand, I killed off the call to svn2git, opting to
convert trunk and the remote branches myself (easily done by
copying-and-pasting the relevant Perl code). Then all I needed to do was clean
up the extant tags and run git-filter-branch to make the grafts
permanent:


sub finish {
    print "Deleting old tags\n";
    my @tags = grep m{^tags/}, map { s/^\s+//; s/\s+$//; $_ } `git branch -a`;
    system qw(git branch -r -D), $_ for @tags;

    print "Deleting revision tags\n";
    @tags_to_delete = grep { /^\d+$/ } map { s/^\s+//; s/\s+$//; $_ } `git tag`;
    system qw(git tag -d), $_ for @tags_to_delete;

    print "Grafting...\n";
    system qw(git filter-branch);
    system qw(git gc);
}


And now I have a nicely organized Git repository based on the Bricolage
Subversion repository, with all (or most) merges in their proper places,
release tags, and branch tracking. Now all I have to do is stitch it together
with the repository based on CVS and I'll be ready
to put this sucker on GitHub! More on that in my next post.

titleMigrating Bricolage CVS to Git
body≥uFollowing a discussion on the Bricolage developers
mail list, I started down the path last week of migrating the Bricolage
Subversion repository to Git. This turned out to be much more work than I
expected, but to the benefit of the project, I think. Since I had a lot of
questions about how to do certain things and how Git thinks about certain
things, I wanted to record what I worked out here over the course of a few
entries. Maybe it will help you manage your migration to Git.

The first thing I tried to do was use git-svn to migrate
Bricolage to Git. I pointed it to the
root directory and let it
rip. I immediately saw that it noticed that the root was originally at the
root of the repository, rather than the ‚Äúbricolage‚Äù subdirectory, and so
followed that path and started pulling stuff down. In a separate terminal
window, I was watching the branches build up, and there were a lot of
them, many named like:


David
David@5248
David@584
tags/Release_1_2_1
tags/Release_1_2_1@5249
tags/Release_1_2_1@577


Although many of those branches and tags hadn't been used since the
beginning of time, and certainly not since Bricolage was moved to Subversion
from its
original home in SourceForge
CVS, because Subversion has no real concept of branches or
tags, git-svn was duly copying them all, including the
separate histories for each. Yow.

I could have dealt with that, renaming things, deleting others, and
grafting where appropriate (more on grafting in a minute), but then I got this
error from git-svn:


bricolage/branches/rev_1_8/lib/Bric/App/ApacheConfig.pm was not
found in commit e5145931069a511e98a087d4cb1a8bb75f43f899 (r5256)


This was annoying, especially since the file clearly does exist in
that commit:


svn list -r5256 http://svn.bricolage.cc/bricolage/branches/rev_1_8/lib/Bric/App/ApacheConfig.pm
ApacheConfig.pm


I posted
to the Git mail list about this issue, but unfortunately got no reply. Given
that it was taking around 30 hours(!) to get to that point (and about 18 hours
once I started using a local copy of the Subversion repository, thank to a
suggestion from Ask Bj√∏rn Hansen), I
started thinking about how to simplify things a bit.

Since most of the moving stuff around happened immediately after the move
to Subversion, and before we started committing working code to the
repository, it occurred to me that I could probably go back to the original
Bricolage CVS Repository on
SourceForge, migrate that to Git, and then just migrate from
Subversion starting from the first real commit there. Then I could just
stitch the
two repositories together.

From CVS to Git

Thanks to advice from IRC, I used
cvs2git to
build a repository from a dump from CVS. Apparently, git
cvsimport makes a lot of mistakes, while cvs2git does a
decent job keeping branches and tags where they should be. It's also pretty
fast; once I set up its configuration and ran it, it took only around 5
minutes for it to build import files for git fast-import. It also
has some nice features to rename symbols (tags), ignore tags, assign authors,
etc. I'm aware of not tool to migrate Subversion to Git that does the same
thing.

Once I had my dump, I started writing a script to import it into Git. The
basic import looks like this:


GITREPO=/Users/david/Desktop/git_from_cvs
rm -rf $GITREPO
mkdir $GITREPO
chdir $GITREPO
git init
cat ../cvs2svn-tmp/git-blob.dat ../cvs2svn-tmp/git-dump.dat | git fast-import
svn2git --no-clone
git gc
git reset --hard


I used svn2git to convert remote branches to local
tags and branches The --no-clone option is what keeps it from
doing the Subversion stuff; everything else is the same for a new conversion
from CVS. I also had to run git reset --hard to throw out
uncommitted local changes. What changes? I'm not sure where they came from,
but after the last commit is imported from CVS, all of the local files in the
master branch are deleted, but that change is not committed. Strange, but by
doing a hard reset, I reverted that change with no harm done.

Next, I started looking at the repository in
GitX, which provides a decent graphical
interface for browsing around a Git repository on Mac OS X. There I discovered
that a major benefit to importing from CVS rather than Subversion is that,
because CVS has real tags, those tags are properly migrated to Git. What this
means is that, because the Bricolage project (nearly) always tagged merges
between branches and included the name of the appropriate tag name in a merge
commit message, I was able to reconstruct the merge history in Git.

For example, there were a lot of tags named like so:


% git tag
rev_1_8_merge-2004-05-04
rev_1_6_merge-2004-05-02
rev_1_6_merge-2004-04-10
rev_1_6_merge-2004-04-09
rev_1_6_merge-2004-03-16


So if I wanted to find the merge commit that corresponded to that first
tag, all I had to do was sort the commits in GitX by date and look near
2004-05-04 for a commit message that said something like:


Merge from rev_1_8. Will tag that branch "rev_1_8_merge-2004-05-04".


That commit's SHA key is ‚Äúb786ad1c0eeb9df827d658a81dc2d32ec6108e92‚Äù. Its
parent's SHA key is ‚Äú11dbbd49644aaa607bd83f8d542d37fcfbd5e63b‚Äù. So then all I
had to do was to tell git that there is a second parent for that commit.
Looking in GitX for the commit tagged ‚Äúrev_1_8_merge-2004-05-04‚Äù, I found that
its SHA key is ‚Äú4fadb117a71a49add69950eccc14b77a04c8ec68‚Äù. So to assign that
as a second parent, I write a line to the file .git/info/grafts
that describes its parentage:


b786ad1c0eeb9df827d658a81dc2d32ec6108e92 11dbbd49644aaa607bd83f8d542d37fcfbd5e63b 4fadb117a71a49add69950eccc14b77a04c8ec68


Once I had all the grafts written, I just ran git
filter-branch and they were permanently rewritten to the new
hierarchy.

And that's it! The parentage is now correct. It was a lot of busy work to
create the mapping between tags and merges, but it's nice to have it all done
and properly mapped out historically in Git. I even found a bunch merges with
no corresponding tags and figured out the proper commit to link them up to
(though I stopped when I got back to 2002 and things get really confusing).
And now, because the merge relationships are now properly recorded in Git, I
can drop those old merge tags: as workarounds for a lack of merge tracking in
CVS, they are no longer necessary in Git.

Next up, how I completed the merge from Subversion. I'll write that once
I've finally got it nailed down. Unfortunately, it takes an hour or two to
export from Subversion to Git, and I'm having to do it over and over again as
I figure stuff out. But it will be done, and you'll hear more about it
here.

time than the first two steps, thanks in large part to the great help from
‚Äúdoener,‚Äù ‚ÄúIlari,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFissure‚Äù on the Freenode #git channel.

Actually, they helped me with a bit more tweaking of my CVS and Subversion
conversions. One thing I realized after writing
yesterday's post was that, after running git
filter-branch, I had twice as many commits as I should have had. It
turns out that git filter-branch rewrites all commits, but keeps
the old ones around in case you mess something up. doener also pointed out
that I wasn't having all grafts properly applied, because git
filter-branch only applies to the currently checked-out branch. To get
all of the branches, he suggested that I read the
git-filter-branch documentation,
where I'll find that git filter-branch --tag-name-filter cat --
--all would hit all branches. Actually, such was not clear to me from
the documentation, but I took his word for it. Once I did that, to get rid
of the dupes, all I had to do was git clone the repository
to a new repository. And that was that.

This worked great for my CVS migration, but I realized that I also wanted
to clean out metadata from the Subversion migration. Of course,
git clone throws out most of the metadata, but git
svn also stores some metadata at the end of every commit log message,
like this:


git-svn-id: file:///Users/david/svn/bricolage/trunk@8581 e630fb3e-2914-11de-beb6-f300316f8eb1


This had been very handy as I looked through commits in GitX to find
parents to set up for grafts, but with that done and everything grafted, I no
longer needed it. Ilari helped me to figure out how to properly use 
git filter-branch to get rid of those. To do it, all I had to do
was add a filter for commit messages, like so:


git filter-branch --msg-filter \
'perl -0777 -pe "s/\r?\ngit-svn-id:.+\n//ms"' \
--tag-name-filter cat -- --all


This properly strips out that ugly bit of metadata and finalizes the grafts
all at the same time. Very nice.

Now it was time to combine these two repositories for a single
unified history. I wasn't able to find a good tutorial for this on the web,
other
than one
that used a third-party Debian utility and only hooked up the master branch,
using a bogus intermediary commit to do it. On the other hand, simply copying
the pack files, as mentioned in the
Git
Wiki--and demonstrated by the scripts linked from there--also appeared to
be suboptimal: The new commits were not showing up in GitX! And besides, Ilari
said, ‚Äújust copying packs might not suffice. There can also be loose objects.‚Äù
Well, we can't have that, can we?

Ilari suggested git-fetch, the
documentation for which says that it will
‚Äúdownload objects and refs from another repository.‚Äù Perfect! I wanted to copy
the objects from my CVS migration to the Subversion migration.

My first attempt failed: some commits showed up, but not others. Ilari
pointed out that it wouldn't copy remote branches unless you asked it to do
so, via ‚Äúrefspecs.‚Äù Since I'd cloned the repositories to get rid of the
duplicate commits created by git filter-branch, all of my
lovingly recreated local branches were now remote branches. Actually, this is
what I want for the final repository, so I just had to figure out how to copy
them. What I came up with was this:


chdir $cvs;
my @branches = map { s/^\s+//; s/\s+$//; $_ } `git branch -r`;

chdir $svn;
system qw(git fetch --tags), $cvs;

for my $branch (@branches) {
    next if $branch eq 'origin/HEAD';
    my $target = $branch =~ m{/master|rev_1_[68]$} ? "$branch-cvs" : $branch;
    system qw(git fetch --tags), $cvs,
        "refs/remotes/$branch:refs/remotes/$target";
}


It took me a while to figure out the proper incantation for referencing and
creating remote branches. Once I got the refs/remotes part
figured out, I found that the master, rev_1_6, and rev_1_8 branches from CVS
were overwriting the Subversion branches with the same names. What I really
needed was to have the CVS branches grafted as parents to the Subversion
branches. The #git channel again came to my rescue, where Fissure suggested
that I rename those branches when importing them, do the grafts, and then drop
the renamed branches. Hence the line above that adds ‚Äú-cvs‚Äù to the names of
those branches.

Once the branches were imported, I simply looked for the earliest commits
to those branches in Subversion and mapped it to the latest commits to the
same branches in CVS, then wrote their SHA1 IDs to
.git/info/grafts, like so:


open my $fh, '>', ".git/info/grafts" or die "Cannot open grafts: $!\n";
print $fh '77a35487f18d68b96d294facc1f1a41745ad914c '
       => "835ff47ee1e3d1bf228b8d0976fbebe3c7f02ae6\n", # rev_1_6
          '97ef646f5c2a7c6f47c2046c8d289c1dfc30a73d '
       => "2b9f3c5979d062614ef54afd0a01631f746fa3cb\n", # rev_1_8
          'b3b2e7f53d789bea962fe8047e119148e28865c0 '
       => "8414b64a6a434b2117294c0568c1012a17bc863b\n", # master
    ;
close $fh;


With the branches all imported and the grafts created, I simply had to
run git filter-branch to make them permanent and drop the
temporary CVS branches:


system qw(git filter-branch --tag-name-filter cat -- --all);
unlink '.git/info/grafts';
system qw(git branch -r -D), "origin/$_-cvs" for qw(rev_1_6 rev_1_8 master);


Now I had a complete repository, but with duplicate commits left over
by git-filter-branch. To get rid of those, I need to clone the
repository. But before I clone, I need the remote branches to be local
branches, so that the clone will see them as remotes. For this, I wrote 
the following function:


sub fix_branches {
    for my $remote (map { s/^\s+//; s/\s+$//; $_ } `git branch -r`) {
        (my $local = $remote) =~ s{origin/}{};
        next if $local eq 'master';
        next if $local eq 'HEAD';
        system qw(git checkout), $remote;
        system qw(git checkout -b), $local;
    }
    system qw(git checkout master);
}


It's important to skip the master and HEAD branches, as they'll
automatically be created by git clone. So then I call the
function and and run git gc to take out trash, and then
clone:


fix_branches();

run qw(git gc);
chdir '..';
run qw(git clone), "file://$svn", 'git_final';


It's important to use the file:/// URL to clone so as to get a
real clone; just pointing to the directory instead makes hard links.

Now I that I had the final repository with all history intact, I was ready
to push it to GitHub! Well, almost ready. First I needed to make the branches
local again, and then see if I could get the repository size down a bit:


chdir 'git_final';
fix_branches();
system qw(git remote rm origin);
system qw(git remote add origin git@github.com:bricoleurs/bricolage.git);
system qw(git gc);
system qw(git repack -a -d -f --depth 50 --window 50);


And that's it! My new Bricolage Git repository is complete, and I've now
pushed it up to its new home on GitHub. I pushed it
like this:


git push origin --all
git push origin --tags


Damn I'm glad that's done! I'll be getting the Subversion repository set to
read-only next, and then writing some documentation for my fellow Bricoleurs
on how to work with Git. For those of you who already
know, fork and enjoy!

title-How to Globally Change a Subversion Username
bodyñYI successfully migrated the Kineticode Subversion repository to a new server yesterday. Everything works great. But after my first commit, I realized that, while my username on the old server was theory, on the new server it's david. Subversion works fine, of course, and I was able to start committing from old checkouts using the new username, but I realized that sites like Ohloh would pick up the two usernames as separate usernames. So I wanted to update all of the 3630 existing revisions that were mine to use the new username.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find much on how to do this in a quick Googling. But I quickly figured out that what I need to do was to svnadmin dump my repository, modify the dump, and then load it again. The Subversion dump format has all these fields for tracking the content-lengths of various, so doing the update was a bit tricky. But I wrote the script here to track things, and it worked great for me. So here it is for others to reference and use.


#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use warnings;

while (<>) {
    print;
    next unless /^Revision-number:\s+\d+$/;

    # Grab the content lengths. Examples:
    # Prop-content-length: 139
    # Content-length: 139
    my $plen_line = <>;
    my $clen_line = <>;

    unless ( $plen_line =~ /^Prop-content-length:\s+\d+$/ ) {
        # Nothing we want to change.
        print $plen_line, $clen_line;
        next;
    }

    my @lines;
    while ( <> ) {
        if ( /^PROPS-END$/ ) {
            # finish.
            print $plen_line, $clen_line, @lines, $_;
            last;
        }

        push @lines, $_;

        if ( /^svn:author$/ ) {
            # Grab the author content length. Example:
            # V 6
            my $alen_line = <>;

            # Grab the author name.
            my $auth = <>;

            if ( $auth =~ s/^theory$/david/ ) {
                # Adjust the content lengths.
                for my $line ( $plen_line, $clen_line, $alen_line ) {
                    $line =~ s/(\d+)$/$1 - 1/e;
                }
            }
            print $plen_line, $clen_line, @lines, $alen_line, $auth;
            last;
        }
    }
}


To use it, save it to a file, say svn_author, then change line 40 to your old and new usernames. Then, on line 43, change the $1 - 1 bit to be correct for the difference between the usernames you're changing. For example, if you're changing your username from, say, shane to chromatic, the new name is five characters longer, so you'd make it $1 + 5.

Now, run it like so:


svnadmin dump /path/to/svnroot > svndump.out
perl svn_author svndump.out > svndump.in
svnadmin create /path/to/new/svnroot
svnadmin load /path/to/new/svnroot < svndump.in


And that's it! Feel free to take this code and do with it what you like, including fix any bugs, add command-line options, support changing multiple authors at once, or whatever. Share and enjoy.

title$iPod Threatens UK Military Security
bodyåq

Following up on my screed against the idea of the iPod security threat, James Duncan Davidson sent me a link to this story about how the UK military has decided that the iPod is a security threat.


  With USB devices, if you plug it straight into the computer you can
  bypass passwords and get right on the system, RAF Wing Commander Peter
  D'Ardenne told Reuters.

  That's why we had to plug that gap, he said, adding that the
  policy was put into effect when the MoD switched to the USB-friendly
  Microsoft XP operating system over the past year.


Huh. Do you mean to tell me that if you plug into the USB port of a PC that
no one is logged in to, you can get access to the contents of the PC without
logging in? You know, that sounds more like a Windows security flaw
than an iPod problem. I mean, it's reasonable for the military to ban external
media in order to prevent their personnel and contractors from copying
sensitive data onto personal devices for unknown purposes. But this Windows
security hole seems, well, huge.

And the truth is that these articles that single out the iPod as a security
threat are being disingenuous, in that it's much easier and much cheaper to use
a USB Flash Drive. Furthermore, this
banning of storage devices really only keeps honest people honest; those who
really want to copy sensitive information to take home will figure out a way to
do it if they're motivated enough.

So yeah, highly sensitive security establishments should ban personal
external storage devices to keep honest people honest, but really, they should
also fix the real security problem with their operating system of choice.

titleWindows Virus Hell
body∞iSo to finish up development and testing of Test.Harness.Browser in IE 6 last week, I rebooted my Linux server (the one running justatheory.com) into Windows 98, got everything working, and rebooted back into Linux. I felt that the hour or two's worth of downtime for my site was worth it to get the new version of Test.Simple out, and although I had ordered a new Dell, didn't want to wait for it. And it worked great; I'm very pleased with Test.Simple 0.20.

But then, in unrelated news, I released Bricolage 1.9.0, the first development release towards Bricolage 1.10, which I expect to ship next month. One of the things I'm most excited about in this release is the new PHP templating support. So on George Schlossnagle's advice, I sent an email to webmaster@php.net. It bounced. It was late on Friday, and I'm so used to bounces being problems on the receiving end, that I simply forwarded it to George with the comment, What the? and went to fix dinner for company.

Then this morning I asked George, via IM, if he'd received my email. He hadn't. I sent it again; no dice. So he asked me to paste the bounce, and as I did so, looked at it more carefully. It had this important tidbit that I'd failed to notice before:


140.211.166.39 failed after I sent the message.
Remote host said: 550-5.7.1 reject content [xbl]
550 See http://master.php.net/mail/why.php?why=SURBL


That's curious, I thought, and went to read the page in question. It said I likely had a domain name in my email associated with a blacklisted IP address. Well, there were only two domain names in that email, bricolage.cc and justatheory.com, and I couldn't see how either one of them could have been identified as a virus host. But sure enough, a quick search of the CBL database revealed that the IP address for justatheory.com‚Äîand therefore my entire home LAN‚Äî had been blacklisted. I couldn't imagine why; at first I thought maybe it was because of past instances of blog spam appearing here, but then George pointed out that the listing had been added on August 18. So I thought back‚Ä¶and realized that was just when I was engaging in my JavaScript debugging exercise.

Bloody Windows!

So I took steps to correct the problem:


  Update my router's firmware. I've been meaning to do that for a while, anyway, and was hoping to get some new firewall features. Alas, no, but maybe I'll be able to connect to a virtual PPTP network the next time I need to.
  Blocked all outgoing traffic from any computer on my LAN on port 25. I send email through my ISP, but use port 587 because I found in the last year that I couldn't send mail on port 25 on some networks I've visited (such as in hotels). Now I know why: so that no network users inadvertently send out viruses from their Windows boxes! I'd rather just prevent certain hosts (my Windows boxen) from sending on port 25, but the router's NAT is not that sophisticated. So I have to block them all.
  Rebooted the server back into Windows 98 and installed and ran Norton AntiVirus. This took forever, but found and fixed two instances of WIN32Mimail.l@mm and removed a spyware package.
  Rebooted back into Linux and cleared my IP address from the blacklist databases. I don't expect to ever use that box for Windows again, now that I have the new Dimension.
  

The new box comes with Windows XP SP 2 and the Symantec tools, so I don't expect it to be a problem, especially since it can't use port 25. But this is a PITA, and I really feel for the IT departments that have to deal with this shit day in and day out.

What I don't understand is how I got this virus, since I haven't used Windows 98 in this computer in a long time. How long? Here's a clue: When I clicked the link in Norton AntiVirus to see more information on WIN32Mimail.l@mm, Windows launched my default browser: Netscape Communicator! In addition, I don't think I've used this box to check email since around 2000, and I never click on attachments from unknown senders, and never .exe or .scr files at all (my mail server automatically rejects incoming mail with such attachments, and has for at least a year).

But anyway, it's all cleaned up now, and I've un-blacklisted my IP, so my emails should be deliverable again. But I'm left wondering what can be done about this problem. It's easy for me to feel safe using my Mac, Linux, and FreeBSD boxes, but, really, what keeps the Virus and worm writers from targeting them? Nothing, right? Furthermore, what's to stop the virus and worm writers from using port 587 to send their emails? Nothing, right? Once they do start using 587‚Äîand I'm sure they will‚Äîhow will anyone be able to send mail to an SMTP server on one network from another network? Because you know that once 587 becomes a problem, network admins will shut down that port, too.

So what's to be done about this? How can one successfully send mail to a server not on your local network? How will business people be able to send email through their corporate servers from hotel networks? I can see only a few options:


  Require them to use a mail server on the local network. They'll have to reconfigure their mail client to use it, and then change it back when they get back to the office. What a PITA. This might work out all right if there was some sort of DNS-like service for SMTP servers, but then there would then be nothing to prevent the virus software from using it, either.
  You can't. You have to authenticate onto the other network using a VPN. Lots of companies rely on this approach already, but smaller companies that don't have the IT resources to set up a VPN are SOL. And folks just using their ISPs are screwed, too.
  Create a new email protocol that's inherently secure. This would require a different port, some sort of negotiation and authentication process, and a way for the hosting network to know that it's cool to use. But this probably wouldn't work, either, because then the virus software can also connect via such a protocol to a server that's friendly to it, right?


None of these answers is satisfactory. I guess I'll have to set up an authenticating SMTP server and a VPN for Kineticode once port 587 starts getting blocked. Anyone else got any brilliant solutions to this problem?

title#Gartner: iPod is a Security Threat
bodyã 

Well, this is entertaining. It seems that the Gartner Group has decided that iPods are a significant security threat. I think it's great that a company like that makes its money by telling people that, yes, you can copy files between your PC and your iPod, and that poses a serious security threat. Please.

The problem, of course, is not the iPod. Or digital cameras. Or floppies. Or CD burners. No, the problem is people. I prefer to build a company that trusts its employees. Novel concept, I know. So here's the mantra: iPods aren't security threats; employees are security threats.

Now, I had to think carefully about posting this, because it reminded me, suddenly, of the old gun nut statement that guns don't kill people, people kill people. The reason why I'm willing to use it for the iPod and not guns, however, has to do with design. Guns are designed to kill. It kind of makes the statement moot. I mean, what would you expect people to do with them? iPods, however, are not designed to breach security. They're designed to listen to music, to store files, to copy your calendar, etc. Now, whether an individual person decides to use the iPod in breach of a company's security protocols is a matter independent of the iPod's design and intended use.

So the mantra holds: iPods aren't security threats; employees are security threats. But guns, yeah, they're pretty much designed for killing.

title6New Just a Theory Blog Policy: Limited Comment Period
bodyãaI've had an open policy on comments on this blog since it started. A couple years ago, I added a timeout on trackback pings, so that you can't trackback ping a posting more than two weeks after I wrote it. But I left manual comments in, along with the simple math bit, since comments and spam have been low volume.

Curiously, though, although this is not a popular blog, and I've posted to it all of twice in the last six months, I've been getting a lot more comment spam in the last few weeks. I've been having to manually delete upwards of 100 spam comments a day. Well, I'm bored with that. So I hereby announce a new comment policy: You can comment on a blog post for up to two weeks after I post it. After that, the comment period will be over. I'm sorry to have to do this, and maybe it will change if I ever switch to Word Press or something, but for now, I think it will do.

The vast majority of non-spam comments I get on any particular post after two weeks or so is a request for support. So I don't think that the new policy will hamper anyone much, and for those looking for support, well, this is not the appropriate forum. But if you do feel compelled to comment on something after the comment period, just email your comment to me and I'll add it in as I deem appropriate.

Thanks for understanding. I really appreciate getting this time back every day. And, of course, if you'd like to respond to this new policy in any way, well, you have two weeks to leave a comment on this post. ;-)

bodyäzI'm working on a project where I aggregate entries from a slew of feeds into a single feed. The output feed will be a valid Atom feed, and of course I want to make sure that I maintain all the appropriate metadata for each entry I collect. The <source> element seems to be exactly what I need:

If an entry is copied from one feed into another feed, then the source feed‚Äôs metadata (all child elements of feed other than the entry elements) should be preserved if the source feed contains any of the child elements author, contributor, rights, or category and those child elements are not present in the source entry.

<source>

  <updated>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</updated>
  <rights>¬© 2005 Example, Inc.</rights>
</source>


That‚Äôs perfect: It allows me to keep the title, link, rights, and icon of the originating blog associated with each entry.

Except, maybe it‚Äôs the database expert in me, but I'd like to be able to have it be more normalized. My feed might have 1000 entries in it from 100 sources. Why would I want to dupe that information for every single entry from a given source? Is there now better way to do this, say to have the source data once, and to reference the source ID only for each entry? That would make for a much smaller feed, I expect, and a lot less duplication.

Is there any way to do this in an Atom feed?

bodyóLately I‚Äôve been fiddling a bit
with Markdown, John Gruber‚Äôs minimalist plain text markup
syntax. I‚Äôve become more and more attracted to Markdown after I‚Äôve had to
spend some time using Trac and, to a lesser degree, Twiki
and MediaWiki. The
plain-text markup syntax in these projects is‚Ä¶how shall I put
this?‚Ä¶gawdawful. Why do I hate these wiki syntaxes? Becaus they‚Äôre
unnatural. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm most familiar with it, but Trac‚Äôs
syntax is just completely random and inconsistent. Trying to get anything
other than simple paragraphs formatted just right is just a giant pain in the
ass. Just try have multiple paragraphs in a hierarchical bulleted list and
you‚Äôll see what I mean. If I wanted to worry about space this much I‚Äôd hack
Python! I mean, seriously, there‚Äôs a reason I write my blog entries in pure
HTML. It‚Äôs not so user-friendly, but at least I know exactly how something
will be formatted when I‚Äôm done.

But Markdown is different. It‚Äôs syntax is almost exactly like what I‚Äôve
been using in lain-text email messages since the mid-1990s. It‚Äôs humane in a
way that Textile only approaches in its inline markup
(as long as you don‚Äôt use attributes, of course). There are a few oddities,
such as the definition list syntax used
by PHP Markdown
Extra
and MultiMarkdown is a
bit unnatural. But overall, it‚Äôs quite close to what I type anyway. I‚Äôve been
writing
the pgTAP
documentation in Markdown,
using Discount to generate the HTML you see on the Web site (plus my
own custom hack to create the table of contents), and it‚Äôs just a thrill that
it‚Äôs so easy to maintain: I can easily read and edit
the README file like any other text file, and then generate the HTML
for the Web site with a simple make target. It has been such a
great experience that I‚Äôm tempted to stop writing documentation
in POD!

So in my next app, I‚Äôll likely be making use of MultiMarkdown for the
end-user management of content. It has nearly everything I want,
formatting-wise, and I can likely get used to the few cases where its syntax
seems a bit weird to me. Plus, I can then use the generated HTML to output
PDFs and other formats from the same document. I expect it to be a dream to
work with. (Oh, and thanks to Aristotle
Pagaltzis for patiently putting up with my questions about markdown in
private email messages; they‚Äôll help keep me from saying anything too
embarrassing on the Markdown mail list!)

In the meantime, I‚Äôve modified the comment system on this blog to support
Markdown. You can still use HTML in comments, same as always, as Markdown
passes HTML through unmolested. But few of you ever did that, and I was always
adding HTML tags to the comments. Now maybe I won‚Äôt have to: Markdown is so
easy and natural to use, that the vast majority of commenters will just leave
paragraphs and they‚Äôll look beautiful.

At any rate, you now have one less reason not to leave a comment!

bodyî

Some of you no doubt noticed that this site was down for several days, starting last Friday and lasting until yesterday. Sorry about that. I had a hard disk failure of some kind on the ca. 1999 OptiPlex I was using. I've had a newer box (ca. 2005) to move to for a while, but lacked the tuits. With this change, I was forced to make the switch. Fortunately, a Debian install CD let me login to the OptiPlex and access all my files, so I was able to recover everything. I even managed to keep the file modification times the same, so feeds won't show everything as unread (which I've seen many times when other bloggers I've known have switched providers or recovered from some catastrophe). Unless you tried to hit this site over the weekend or on Monday or Tuesday, you should notice no changes at all (except speed, the new box is a lot faster!).

Naturally, I took advantage of this opportunity to get my blog configuration into SVN via my Capistrano deployment system. Hell, none of this stuff was even backed up before (although I did back up all my blog entries about a week before this happened‚Äîbut not comments, yow!). The new box is now properly backing itself up and backing up the Kineticode server, and I can make changes to Blosxom and configure and reboot the blog from my MBP. Yay! No more remote editing.

I've also upgraded my ‚Äúserver room,‚Äù moving out the gigantic 17" CRT and putting in the 17" flat panel screen I've had floating around. I also plugged a USB keyboard into my KVM, so I no longer have to move keyboards around when I switch between the Linux server and the G3 Mac server. Of course, now that I have large disks and Time Machine running on all the other boxes in the house, we don't use the G3 anymore. So I think we'll be donating it soon.

Another change I've made was to stop doing my own log analysis (the command-line tools are such a PITA) and switched to Google Analytics and FeedBurner for tracking visitors to the blog and its feeds. I've still got the old log files around, so I can see how things have changed since before the switch to outside analytics providers, but I'll probably just create a report from them and then ignore them from now on. Too much work to track that stuff.

In the future, I'd like to switch from Blosxom to some other tool. Maybe Movable Type, now that it's open source. It's pretty well-regarded and written in Perl, so I could hack it pretty easily. What I should do is avoid writing my own Blog engine. Right? Right?!. In the meantime, I have other priorities, so I'll be sticking to Bloxsom for a while.

So today I ported it to Blosxom. You can get it yourself here. You'll also need to download the Sociable WordPress plugin so that you can get all the necessary images and styling.

titleEmbed HTML on Your Site
bodyëIf you're a regular visitor to my blog (and who could blame you?), you
likely have noticed a few changes recently. In addition to adding the
sociable links a couple days ago, I've
also been adding bits of embedded JavaScript in the right column displaying my
three most recent Tweets and my three most recent Delicious bookmarks. These
work reasonably well: I just embed <script> tags with the
appropriate stuff, then style the HTML that they deliver.

Tonight I was talking to Skud about embedding like this.
It turns out that some folks were getting a big blank area when they viewed
a blog entry on her site in
RSS readers and the like, they sometimes just saw a big blank area where there
was supposed to be a list of books. She was looking for examples of sites that
provided HTML snippets that people could cut-n-paste into their blog entries,
so that they can avoid this problem, or use it in places that disallow
JavaScript embedding, such as
LiveJournal. I had no examples for
her, but it suddenly occurred to me: Why not embed a link to an HTML URL that
serves a snippet of HTML, rather than a bit of JavaScript that uses
the document object to write HTML?

A quick Googling and I found a page
a great article about the <object> element.
It was intended as a general replacement for the <img>
and <applet> elements, although tht really hasn't happened.
But what you can do is embed HTML with it. Here's a quick example:

code.embedded { background: green; }

  If you can't see this, then the <object> tag doesn't
  work in your browser. :-(


Hopefully you can see the embedded HTML above. I've styled it with a light
blue background and dark blue dotted border, so it stands out. That styling is
in the <object> tag, BTW, not in the HTML loaded from the
snippit. I'm sure I could figure out how to add <param>
tags that would tell it to include various styles, too, since it appears that
CSS I have in this page has no effect on the content of the object (I have
some CSS to make the <code> tag have a green background,
but for me at least, it has no effect.

So why isn't this more common? It
seems to work well in a lot of browsers. Would
you use it? What are the downsides?

title1Need Suggestions for IMAP Solution and Migration
body≠pFor the last several years, I've run
a Courier-IMAP mail server for all of the mail for this site, Kineticode, Strongrrl and other domains. We mainly used
Mail.app on Mac OS X to communicate with the server, and it worked really
well. Today,
Julie has over 3 GB of mail data, and I have around 1.5 GB, all
managed via IMAP.

Recently, I decided it was time to move the mail elsewhere. I've been
meaning to do it for a while, primarily because the server I was using is now
used for the Bricolage project, and because I never set up any spam filtering.
Julie was suddenly getting 100s of spam messages in her inbox. (It really
didn't help that she was still using Panther.) So on the advice of a good
friend who had been evaluating various mail services--and who for now
shall go nameless and therefor blameless--I moved all of our mail to
FuseMail.

At first this seamed like a pretty good solution. Our spam rates went way
down, I could set up unlimited mail lists, aliases, and forwards, and
there was a migration tool that automated moving all of our existing
mail from the old IMAP server to the new one. There were some glitches with
the migration tool, but in the end all of our mail was moved and in tact.

But that's when I started to notice the issues. To summarize:


  Mail put into the Sent Items folder by Mail.app was marked as
  unread. This didn't happen on the old server, and apparently has something
  to so with how FuseMail names the sent folder: Sent Items rather
  than Sent Messages.
  Mail.app is syncing constantly. Even once it had successfully
  synced the all of our email in all of our IMAP folders (which took
  days, it is syncing all the time, to the extent that I am sometimes
  waiting for up to a minute to read a mail when I double-click it, because
  there are all these other threads doing stuff and taking up all the
  resources. It can take several minutes for mail I'm sending to
  be sent (though that might be a delay in Mail.app copying the
  message to the Sent Items folder rather than the actual sending).
  Deleting mail takes forever! This is probably the same issue as
  the syncing problem, but when I delete 1000s of messages from my Junk mail
  folder, it runs forever, and all other activities are delayed eve further.
  It turns out to be much more efficient to empty the Junk and Deleted Items
  folders using the webmail interface. And even then, Mail.app can take a
  while to delete locally-cached items from the folder when it syncs.
  Suddenly, Julie is getting a lot less spam. She went from several
  hundred messages showing up in her Junk mailbox a few days ago to just five
  on Friday and two yesterday--one of which was a false positive). As she had
  been expecting a message from someone that she never got, this naturally
  made her very suspicious. Where is all the spam? Is she getting all of her
  mail?
  Since FuseMail uses a mailbox named Sent Items instead of the
  traditional Sent Messages for all sent mail, I asked if they could
  move the 1.8 GB of messages from Julie's Sent Messages to their Sent Items,
  since Mail.app would just choke on such a task. Though my request was
  escalated to the FuseMail developers, the answer came back no. Which
  I guess means that they're not
  using Maildir, because in that case it would be a
  cinch, n'est pas?
  Backups are not really feasible. Of course FuseMail has its own
  backup regimen, but if I ever want to move elsewhere or deal with some
  sort of catastrophic failure, I want my own backups. There is no
  rsync service available for this (remember: no maildir), so I have to
  use the IMAP interface. I've been trying for the past two weeks to get
  Offline IMAP to back up all of Julie's and my mail, but it keeps
  choking. It gets a little further every time I run it; eventually it will
  get it all. But this only allows me to backup those accounts for which I
  happen to have a password. I have accounts set up for a few other users, but
  don't have access to their passwords, so I can't back them up. This does not
  make for very good support for corporate backup and retention
  policies.
  Mail forwarded by FuseMail has its Return-Path header
  modified. This made RT break until I hacked it to ignore that
  header (which is its by-default preferred header for identifying
  senders.


So I'm pretty fed up. It took me a week to get all of our mail on FuseMail,
and now I'm looking at moving it off again (once OfflineIMAP finishes a full
sync). Grr. I'm considering finding a virtual host somewhere and setting up my
own IMAP server again, but then I have the spam problem again. So then I could
use a forwarding service like Pobox, or I can set up my own spam filtering (something I had hoped
never to get into managing myself). My old IMAP server required very little
maintenance, which was nice, but then the span filtering stuff always seemed
daunting. Don't you have to update things all the time?a

But before I go off and do something else, and unlike before I moved to
FuseMail, I wanted to get an idea what other folks are doing? Do you use IMAP?
Do you use it to manage a shitload (read: Gigabytes) of mail? Do you get very
little spam and still get all of your valid mail? Are IMAP folder maintenance
actions fast for you (in Mail.app in particular)? Are you paying a
not-unreasonable amount of money for your setup? If you answered yes to all of
these questions, please, for the love of all that is good in this world, tell
me how you do it. I'm looking for something that I don't have to work very
hard to maintain (hence my original attempt to have some company that
specializes in this stuff do it), but I'll do what I have to to make this
thing right. So how do you make it right? And if I have to run my own server,
where should I host it that won't cost me an arm and a leg?

Thanks for your help!

title%Has Google Forgotten its on Tagline?
bodyá&My friend Chad Dickerson, the exiting CTO of Infoworld, has blogged about a recent move by Google to patent advertising in RSS!


ncorporating targeted ads into information in a syndicated, e.g., RSS, presentation format in an automated manner is described. Syndicated material e.g., corresponding to a news feed, search results or web logs, are combined with the output of an automated ad server. An automated ad server is used to provide keyword or content based targeted ads. The ads are incorporated directly into a syndicated feed, e.g., with individual ads becoming items within a particular channel of the feed.


This despite the fact that InfoWorld was itself sending targeted ads out in is RSS feeds before Google filed for its patent! Is this another one-click debacle in the making? Does it really make any sense to patent delivering targeted ads over HTTP just because they're in XML instead of HTML?

What do you think?

title$RFC: A Simple Markdown Table Format
bodyÅè6I've been thinking about markdown tables a bit lately. I've had in mind to
follow up on my definition list
proposal with a second proposal for the creation and editing of simple
tables in Markdown. For better or for worse,
an aside on the
markdown-discuss mail list led to
a longish thread about a syntax for continuing lines in tables (not
to mention a long aside on the use of monospaced fonts, but I digress),
wherein I realized, after
an open-minded post
from MultiMarkdown's Fletcher Penney, that I needed to
set to working up this request for comments sooner rather than later.

Requirements

All of which is to say that this blog entry is a request for comments on a
proposed sytnax for simple tables in Markdown. The requirements for such a
feature, to my thinking, are:


  Simple tables only
  Formatting should be implicit
  Support for a simple caption
  Support for representing column headers
  Support for left, right, and center alignment
  Support for multicolumn cells
  Support for empty cells
  Support for multiline (wrapping) cells
  Support for multiple table bodies
  Support for inline Markdown (spans, lists, etc.)
  Support for all features (if not syntax)
    of MultiMarkdown tables.


By ‚Äúsimple tables‚Äù in that first bullet, I mean that they should look good
in 78 character-wide monospaced plain text. Anything more complicated should
just be done in XHTML. My goal is to be able to handle the vast majority of
simple cases, not to handle every kind of table. That's not to say that one
won't be able to use the syntax to create more complicated tables, just that
it might not be appropriate to do so, and many more advanced features of
tables will just have to be done in XHTML.

And by ‚Äúimplicit formatting‚Äù in the second bullet, I mean that the syntax
should use the bare minimum number of punctuation characters to provide hints
about formatting. Another way to think about it is that formatting hints
should be completely invisible to a casual reader of the Markdown text.

Most of the rest of the requirements I borrowed
from MultiMarkdown, with the last
bullet thrown in just to cover anything I might have missed. The MultiMarkdown
syntax appears to be a superset of
the PHP Markdown Extra syntax, so that's covered, too.

Prior Art: Databases

When I think about the display of tables in plain text, the first piece of
prior art I think of is the output from command-line database clients.
Database developers have been thinking about tables since, well, the
beginning, so it makes sense to see what they're doing. So I wrote a bit of
SQL and ran it in three databases. The SQL builds a table with an integer, a
short name, a textual description, and a decimal number. Here's the code:


CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE widgets (
    id          integer,
    name        text,
    description text,
    price       numeric(6,2)
);

INSERT INTO widgets VALUES( 1, 'gizmo', 'Takes care of the doohickies', 1.99);
INSERT INTO widgets VALUES( 2, 'doodad', 'Collects *gizmos*', 23.8);
INSERT INTO widgets VALUES( 10, 'dojigger', 'Handles:
* gizmos
* doodads
* thingamobobs', 102.98);
INSERT INTO widgets VALUES(1024, 'thingamabob', 'Self-explanatory, no?', 0.99);

SELECT * FROM widgets;


My goal here was to see how the database client would format a variety of
data formats, as well as a textual column (‚Äúdescription‚Äù) with newlines in it
(and a Markdown list, no less!), as the newlines will force the output to
appear on multiple lines for a single row. This is one of the features that is
missing from the existing Markdown implementations, which all require that the
text all be on a single line.

The first database client in which I ran this code
was psql 8.3, the interactive
terminal for PostgreSQL 8.3. Its output looks like this:


  id  |    name     |         description          | price  
------+-------------+------------------------------+--------
    1 | gizmo       | Takes care of the doohickies |   1.99
    2 | doodad      | Collects *gizmos*            |  23.80
   10 | dojigger    | Handles:                     | 102.98
                    : * gizmos                       
                    : * doodads                      
                    : * thingamobobs                 
 1024 | thingamabob | Self-explanatory, no?        |   0.99


As you can see, PostgreSQL properly right-aligned the integer and numeric
columns. It also has a very nice syntax for demonstrating continuing lines for
a given column: the colon. The colon is really nice here because it looks kind
of like a broken pipe character, which is an excellent mnemonic for a string
of text that breaks over multiple lines. Really, this is just a very
nice output format overall.

The next database client I tried was mysql 5.0, the command-line client for
MySQL 5.0. Its output looks like this:


+------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+--------+
| id   | name        | description                                | price  |
+------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+--------+
|    1 | gizmo       | Takes care of the doohickies               |   1.99 | 
|    2 | doodad      | Collects *gizmos*                          |  23.80 | 
|   10 | dojigger    | Handles:
* gizmos
* doodads
* thingamobobs | 102.98 | 
| 1024 | thingamabob | Self-explanatory, no?                      |   0.99 | 
+------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+--------+


Once again we have very good alignment of the numeric data types.
Furthermore, MySQL uses exactly the same syntax as PostgreSQL to represent the
separation between column headers and column rows, although the PostgreSQL
version is a bit more minimalist. The MySQL version just hast a little
more stuff in it

Where the MySQL version fails, however, is in the representation of the
continuing lines for the ‚Äúdojigger‚Äù row. First of all, it set the width of the
‚Äúdescription‚Äù column to the longest value in that column, but since that
longest value includes newlines, it actually ends up being much too long‚Äîmuch
longer than PostgreSQL's representation of the same column. And second, as a
symptom of that problem, nothing special is done with the wrapped lines. The
newlines are simply output like any other character, with no attempt to line
up the column. This has the side effect of orphaning the price for the
‚Äúdojiggger‚Äù after the last line of the continuing description. So its
alignment is shot, too.

To be fair, PostgreSQL's display featured almost exactly the same handling
of continuing columns prior to version 8.2. But I do think that their solution
featuring the colons is a good one.

The last database client I tried was SQLite 3.6. This client is the most different of all. I set
.header ON and .mode column and got this output:


id          name        description                   price     
----------  ----------  ----------------------------  ----------
1           gizmo       Takes care of the doohickies  1.99      
2           doodad      Collects *gizmos*             23.8      
10          dojigger    Handles:
* gizmos
* doodads
  102.98    
1024        thingamabo  Self-explanatory, no?         0.99      


I don't think this is at all useful for Markdown.

Prior Art: MultiMarkdown

Getting back to Markdown now, here is the MultiMarkdown syntax, borrowed
from the documentation:


|             |          Grouping           ||
First Header  | Second Header | Third Header |
 ------------ | :-----------: | -----------: |
Content       |          *Long Cell*        ||
Content       |   **Cell**    |         Cell |

New section   |     More      |         Data |
And more      |            And more          |
[Prototype table]


There are a few interesting features to this syntax, including support for
multiple lines of headers, multicolumn cells alignment queues, and captions. I
like nearly everything about this syntax, except for two things:


  There is no support for multiline cell values.
  The exlicit alignment queues are, to my eye, distracting.


The first issue can be solved rather nicely with PostgreSQL's use of the
colon to indicate continued lines. I think it could even optionally use colons
to highlight all rows in the output, not just the continuing one,
as suggested
by Benoit Perdu on the markdown-discuss list:


  id  |    name     |         description          | price  
------+-------------+------------------------------+--------
    1 | gizmo       | Takes care of the doohickies |   1.99
    2 | doodad      | Collects *gizmos*            |  23.80
   10 | dojigger    | Handles:                     | 102.98
      :             : * gizmos                     : 
      :             : * doodads                    : 
      :             : * thingamobobs               : 
 1024 | thingamabob | Self-explanatory, no?        |   0.99


I think I prefer the colon only in front of the continuing cell, but see no
reason why both couldn't be supported.

The second issue is a bit more subtle. My problem with the alignment hints,
embodied by the colons in the header line, is that to the reader of the
plain-text Markdown they fill no obvious purpose, but are provided purely for
the convenience of the parser. In my opinion, if there is some part of the
Markdown syntax that provides no obvious meaning to the user, it should be
omitted. I take this point of view not only for my own selfish purposes, which
are, of course, many and rampant, but from John Gruber's original design goal
for Markdown, which was:


  The overriding design goal for Markdown‚Äôs formatting syntax is to make it
  as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document
  should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it‚Äôs been
  marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown‚Äôs syntax has
  been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest
  source of inspiration for Markdown‚Äôs syntax is the format of plain text
  email.


To me, those colons are formatting instructions. So, how else could we
support alignment of cells but with formatting instructions? Why, by
formatting the cells themselves, of course. Take a look again at the
PostgreSQL and MySQL outputs. both simply align values in their cells. There
is absolutely no reason why a decent parser couldn't do the same on a
cell-by-cell basis if the table Markdown follows these simple rules:


  For a left-aligned cell, the content should have no more than one space
    between the pipe character that precedes it, or the beginning of the
    line.
  For a right-aligned cell, the content should have no more than one space
    between itself and the pipe charater that succeeds it, or the end of the
    line.
  For a centered cell, the content should have at least two characters
    between itself and both its left and right borders.
  If a cell has one space before and one space after its content, it is
    assumed to be left-aligned unless the cell that precedes it or, in the
    case of the first cell, the cell that succeeds it, is right-aligned.


What this means, in effect, is that you can create tables wherein you line
things up for proper display with a proportional font and, in general, the
Markdown parser will know what you mean. A quick example, borrowing from the
PostgreSQL output:


  id  |    name     |         description          |  price  
------+-------------+------------------------------+--------
    1 | gizmo       | Takes care of the doohickies |   1.99 
    2 | doodad      | Collects *gizmos*            |  23.80 
   10 | dojigger    | Handles stuff                | 102.98 
 1024 | thingamabob | Self-explanatory, no?        |   0.99 


The outcome for this example is that:


  The table headers are all center-aligned, because they all have 2 or more
    spaces on each side of their values
  The contents of the ‚Äúid‚Äù column are all right-aligned. This includes
    1024, which ambiguously has only one space on each side of it, so it makes
    the determination based on the preceding line.
  The contents of the ‚Äúname‚Äù column are all left-aligned. This includes
    ‚Äúthingamabob‚Äù, which ambiguously has only one space on each side of it, so
    it makes the determination based on the preceding line.
  The contents of the ‚Äúdescription‚Äù column are also all left-aligned. This
    includes first row, which ambiguously has only one space on each side of
    it, so it makes the determination based on the succeeding
    line.
  And finally, the contents of the ‚Äúprice‚Äù column are all right-aligned.
    This includes 102.98, which ambiguously has only one space on each side of
    it, so it makes the determination based on the preceding line.


And that's it. The alignments are perfectly clear to the parser and highly
legible to the reader. No further markup is required.

Proposed Syntax

So, with this review, I'd like to propose the following syntax. It is
inspired largely by a combination of PostgreSQL and MySQL's output, as well as
by MultiMarkdown's syntax.


  A table row is identifiable by the use of one or more pipe
    (|) characters in a line of text, aside from those found in a
    literal span (backticks).
  Table headers are identified as a table row with the
    immediately-following line containing
    only -, |, +, :or
    spaces. (This is the same as the MultiMarkdown syntax, but with the
    addition fo the plus sign.)
  Columns are separated by |, except on the header underline,
    where they may optionally be separated by +, and on continuing
    lines (see next point).
  Lines that continue content from one or more cells from a previous line
    must use : to separate cells with continued content. The
    content of such cells must line up with the cell width on the first line,
    determined by the number of spaces (tabs won't work). They may optionally
    demarcate all cells on continued lines, or just the cells that contain
    continued content.
  Alignment of cell content is to be determined on a cell-by-cell basis,
    with reference to the same cell on the preceding or succeeding line as
    necessary to resolve ambiguities.
  To indicate that a cell should span multiple columns, there should be
    additional pipes (|) at the end of the cell, as in
    MultiMarkdown. If the cell in question is at the end of the row, then of
    course that means that pipes are not optional at the end of that row.
  You can use normal Markdown markup within the table cells, including
    multiline formats such as lists, as long as they are properly indented and
    denoted by colons on succeeding lines.
  Captions are optional, but if present must be at the beginning of the
    line immediately preceding or following the table, start
    with [ and end with ], as in MultiMarkdown. If
    you have a caption before and after the table, only the first match will
    be used.
  If you have a caption, you can also have a label, allowing you to create
    anchors pointing to the table, as in MultiMarkdown. If there is no label,
    then the caption acts as the label.
  Cells may not be empty, except as represented by the appropriate number
    of space characters to match the width of the cell in all rows.
  As in MultiMarkdown. You can create multiple <tbody>
    tags within a table by having a single empty line between rows of the
    table.


Sound like a lot? Well, if you're acquainted with MultiMarkdown's syntax,
it's essentially the same, but with these few changes:


  Implicit cell alignment
  Cell content continuation
  Stricter use of space, for proper alignment in plain text (which all of
    the MultiMarkdown examples I've seen tend to do anyway)
  Allow + to separate columns in the header-demarking lines
  A table does not have to start right at the beginning of a line


I think that, for purposes of backwards compatibility, we could still allow
the use of : in the header lines to indicate alignment, thus also
providing a method to override implicit alignment in those rare cases where
you really need to do so. I think that the only other change I would make is
to eliminate the requirement that the first row be made the table header row
if now header line is present. But that's a gimme, really.

Takin the original MultiMarkdown example and rework it with these changes
yields:


|               |            Grouping            ||
+---------------+---------------------------------+
| First Header  |  Second Header  |  Third Header |
+---------------+-----------------+---------------+
| Content       |           *Long Cell*          ||
: continued     :                                ::
: content       :                                ::
| Content       |    **Cell**     |          Cell |
: continued     :                 :               :
: content       :                 :               :

| New section   |      More       |          Data |
| And more      |             And more           ||
 [Prototype table]


Comments?

I think I've gone on long enough here, especially since it ultimately comes
down to some refinements to the MultiMarkdown syntax. Ultimately, what I'm
trying to do here is to push MultiMarkdown to be just a bit more
Markdownish (by which I mean that it's more natural to read as plain text), as
well as to add a little more support for some advanced features. The fact that
I'll be able to cut-and-paste the output from my favorite database utilities
is a handy bonus.

As it happens, John Gruber today
posted
a comment to the markdown-discuss mail list in which he says (not for the
first time, I expect):


  A hypothetical official table syntax for Markdown will almost certainly
    look very much, if not exactly, like Michel's table syntax in PHP Markdown
    Extra.


I hope that he finds this post in that vein, as my goals here were to
embrace the PHP Markdown Extra and MultiMarkdown formats, make a few tweaks,
and see what people think, with an eye toward contributing toward a (currently
hypothetical) official table syntax.

So what do you think? Please leave a comment, or comment on
the markdown-discuss list, where I'll post a synopsis of my proposal
and a link to this entry. What have I missed? What mistakes have I made? What
do you like? What do you hate? Please do let me know.

Thanks!

title0A Modest Proposal for Markdown Definition Lists
bodyµI realize that greater minds than mind have likely given a lot of thought
to how best to implement a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù syntax for definition lists
in Markdown. The best I‚Äôve seen, however, is that
implemented
by PHP Markdown Extra, which is
also supported
by MultiMarkdown. Given
the prevalence of these two libraries, I‚Äôm assuming that the syntax become the
de-facto standard for definition lists in Markdown. But, to my mind at least,
it leaves something to be desired. Here‚Äôs an extended example, taken from the
PHP Markdown Extra documentation, including multiple definitions, multiple
paragraphs, and nested formatting (lists, code block):


Term 1

  : This is a definition with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum 
    dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam 
    hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus.

  : Second definition for term 1, also wrapped in a paragraph
    because of the blank line preceding it.

Term 2

  : This definition has a code block, a blockquote and a list.

        code block.

    > block quote
    > on two lines.

    1.  first list item
    2.  second list item


This format has a lot going for it, in that it covers most of the
requirements for definition lists. In particular, it allows a term to have
multiple definitions, or for multiple terms to share a definition, and for a
definition to have multiple paragraphs, nested lists, code blocks, and other
formatting. There‚Äôs only one problem with it, as far as I‚Äôm concerned: I would 
never write a definition list like this in an email.

I started thinking about alternates, first by thinking about how
I would write a definition list in plain text. It would likely be
something like this:


Term 1
&#xz002d;&#xz002d;&#xz002d;&#xz002d;&#xz002d;&#xz002d;
  This is a definition with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum 
  dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam 
  hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

  Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
  vitae, risus.

  Second definition for term 1, also wrapped in a paragraph
  because of the blank line preceding it.

Term 2
&#xz002d;&#xz002d;&#xz002d;&#xz002d;&#xz002d;&#xz002d;
  This definition has a code block, a blockquote and a list.

      code block.

  > block quote
  > on two lines.

  1.  first list item
  2.  second list item


This is much more like what I‚Äôve actually written in the past. From the
point of view of Markdown, however, there are precedents that make it
problematic, namely:


  The underline for the terms is already used for secondary headers
  Lists with multiple paragraphs need to be indented four spaces or one
  tab (never mind that this
  can cause
  conflicts with code blocks following lists)
  There is no way to tell whether the paragraphs for a given term
  constitute a single definition with multiple paragraphs, multiple
  definitions, or some combination.


This last item never would have occurred to me, since I have never used
more than one definition per term, but have often used multiple paragraphs in
a single definition. However, when I think about the literal use of
definitions--you know, to define a term, I think about a dictionary, which of
course will offer many definitions for a single term. So clearly, there needs
to be a way to distinguish definitions from paragraphs.

So I started thinking about it some more, trying to figure out why I don‚Äôt
like the PHP Markdown Extra syntax, since it solves this problem by using ‚Äú:‚Äù
to identify a term. But then it hit me: Definitions are just a list, and the
‚Äú:‚Äù is the bullet that identifies a list item. PHP Markdown Extra actually
reinforces this interpretation, since it in all ways makes definitions conform
with basic list syntax. This is a good symmetry and easy to remember.

So why do I hate the syntax? Once I realized this bit about the list, I
immediately knew what I hated about it: ‚Äú:‚Äù is a shitty bullet. As a native
speaker and writer of American English, I no doubt bring my cultural biases to
the table, but I would never use a colon at the beginning of
something, only at the end. It just doesn‚Äôt belong there, hanging out in
space. It‚Äôs too subtle, conveys no meaning that I can see, and thus have no
obvious mnemonics to make it memorable.

So I started hunting around my keyboard for an alternate, and stumbled almost
at once on the tilde, ‚Äú~‚Äù. Consider this example, which in all ways is just like
the PHP Markdown Extra syntax, except that the colon is replaced with a tilde:


Term 1:

  ~ This is a definition with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum 
    dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam 
    hendrerit mi posuere lectus.

    Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet
    vitae, risus.

  ~ Second definition for term 1, also wrapped in a paragraph
    because of the blank line preceding it.

Term 2:

  ~ This definition has a code block, a blockquote and a list.

        code block.

    > block quote
    > on two lines.

    1.  first list item
    2.  second list item


Well, okay I did add the trailing colon to the terms, but that‚Äôs
just more natural to me, and could be optional. But otherwise, it‚Äôs the tilde
that‚Äôs different. This to me is much more natural. I‚Äôd be perfectly
willing to write a definition list in email messages this way (and I think I
will from now on). It works well with shorter definition lists, too, of
course:


Apple:
  ~ Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in the family Rosaceae.
  ~ An american computer company.

Orange:
  ~ The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.


See how nice that is? So, you might ask, why the tilde rather than the
colon? As I said before, the colon doesn‚Äôt look right out there in front, it‚Äôs
not a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù way to write definitions because it‚Äôs not a natural choice for
a bullet. The tilde, however, is perfectly comfortable hanging out at the
beginning of a line as a bullet, resembling as it does the dash, already used
for unordered lists in Markdown. Furthermore, it‚Äôs already used in
dictionaries. According to Wikipedia, The swung
dash is often used in dictionaries to represent a word that was mentioned
before and is understood, to save space. Not an exact parallel, but at
least the tilde‚Äôs cousin the swung dash has to do with definitions! Not only
that, but in mathematics, according to Wikipedia again, the
tilde is often used to denote an
equivalence relation between two objects. That works: a definition is a
series of words that define a term; that is, they are a kind of
equivalent!

So I would like to modestly propose to the Markdown community that the
PHP Markdown Extra definition list syntax be adopted as a standard with this
one change. What do you think?

titleDisposable Computing
bodyôk

Over the last year or so, we‚Äôve been on a ‚Äúclear out the junk‚Äù kick in our house. We‚Äôve gotten rid of all of our CDs, most of our books, and a lot of clutter and crap in our house. It‚Äôs kind of funny, because as a former academic, I‚Äôve always liked having stuff, especially lots of books. But no more. I mainly want to read books on my iPad or iPhone nowadays and have less clutter in the house. I‚Äôm at the point now that, when I saw Panic‚Äôs commemoration of Steve Jobs yesterday ‚Äî featuring a recently-discovered photo of Steve sitting on the floor or his house with nothing but a lamp, a stereo, and a mug of tea ‚Äî I thought to myself, ‚Äúnow that‚Äôs about right.‚Äù Nothing but the essentials.

I think that Steve‚Äôs philosophy of minimalism applies just as well to most Mac products. I don‚Äôt mean only not in the way most folks have discussed ad nauseum: the simple interfaces, few buttons, smooth edges. But also in the quality. Apple products are meant to be used ‚Äî well used ‚Äî for a long time. Macs famously last longer than PCs, and the build quality of the unibody MacBook Pros, Airs, iPhones, and iPads, is universally lauded. I‚Äôve had a few iPhones since 2007, and have always managed to get a good price for them via Craig‚Äôs List, not only because people want them, but because they were still in good shape after extended use. These products are meant to last.



Marco Arment‚Äôs $79 Kindle review catalyzed these thoughts for me. The words that really struck me were ‚Äúcheap‚Äù and ‚Äúdisposable.‚Äù The new low-end Kindle is designed to be disposable. Money quote:

Knowing that this new Kindle costs less than the cover for my Kindle 2 is freeing: I can just carry it around uncased and unprotected in a (large) pocket, use it anywhere, and not worry about damaging an expensive electronic item, because it‚Äôs not. And it‚Äôs so inexpensive that I have no hesitation recommending it to pretty much anyone who ever reads books, because I know that if they end up disliking it or not using it much, it wasn‚Äôt a lot of money.

It also means that, if you have it for six or twelve months and it breaks, it‚Äôs not a big deal to buy another one. A year later, another. Pretty soon you have a bunch of these things in your house, collecting like corpses in a cemetery. Because they‚Äôre so cheap to begin with, once they break, they‚Äôre not worth anything at all. You won‚Äôt be able to sell them to anyone. They‚Äôre just junk at that point.



I‚Äôm over junk culture. I hate wasteful packaging, but even worse is wasteful products. I don‚Äôt want a cheap, crappy Kindle, because in a year it will just be more trash ‚Äî either additional household clutter or landfill. We already generate way too much waste, especially in the US. I think it‚Äôs a much better investment to buy a product with good build quality, that‚Äôs built to last. Not only will my iPad last me for years, but it will still have value years from now. It‚Äôs far more likely that it will still be functional in two years than the $79 Kindle will be, or even two or three Kindles.

The iPad is a Contigo thermal mug; the Kindle is a Dixie cup. I‚Äôll take the quality and durability every time. Longer term, it likely won‚Äôt cost me any more ‚Äî and certainly costs the planet less.

titleMissing the Point
bodyèThanks for all the comments on my Disposable Computing post. Alas, I‚Äôm beginning to see why sites like Daring Fireball don‚Äôt allow comments. Not that anyone was rude; it‚Äôs just that everyone missed the point. Every last one of you. (Well, except commenter ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù, who pointed out an inaccuracy in my post.) Here‚Äôs what that post was not about:


How many iPhones I‚Äôve had over the years
The economics of owning an iPad vs. owning a Kindle
How long any given Apple product lasted (yours or mine)
How durable previous generations of Kindles are
The inherent value of the iPhone 3GS or iPad 1
The difference in quality between E-ink and LCD displays



Here‚Äôs what the post was about:


Apple products tend to have great build quality and durability
Marco Arment‚Äôs $79 Kindle review used the terms ‚Äúcheap‚Äù and ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù to describe the Kindle.
The last thing I want in my life is cheap and disposable objects
I‚Äôd rather have objects that are more durable and likely to last
So I‚Äôd rather have an iPad than a $79 Kindle.





That‚Äôs about it. I‚Äôve never used a Kindle device, just the Kindle iOS app. I don‚Äôt know how crappy the new Kindle actually is. Maybe Marco‚Äôs wrong, and  the $79 Kindle is actually incredibly well-built and durable and will last for years. I just know that if it appears to be cheap and non-durable, I don‚Äôt want it. And I think Marco is a pretty reliable source. So I don‚Äôt want a $79 Kindle.

Perhaps my analogy of the $79 Kindle to a Dixie cup was a wee bit overwrought. Sorry about that; it occurred to me as I was writing the piece and I felt that it captured what I wanted to day. Because, you know, I‚Äôd rather drink my coffee out of a Contigo thermal mug than out of a Starbucks paper cup. Maybe that‚Äôs not fair.



So how about this? The $79 Kindle is a Starbucks plastic mug. Not quite Dixie-cup disposable, and the advertising helps keep the price down.

titleCond√© Nast on the iPad
body”>I've been a The New Yorker reader for nearly two decades. I'm a huge fan of the magazine, which in my humble has the best reportage anywhere. So I was thrilled last year when the magazine's publisher, Cond√© Nast, decided to make all issues available to paper subscribers for no extra charge. Ever since, I have loved getting the latest issue late on Sunday nights, rather than on the following Friday or Saturday. It has also made it easier for Strongrrl and me to share the magazine: I usually read the iPad version and she reads the paper version.

That's not to say that it has all been happiness and joy, mind. The New Yorker app is terrible. Issues are huge (typically around 120 MB). Downloads cannot be performed in the background (except by Newsstand, which may not notice a new issue for days). You can't even read other issues while waiting for one to download; the download pauses. Sometimes I have difficulty getting it to start downloading again. And the navigation, while unique and kind of interesting, really does not work for me.

Still, I was excited to try it on the new iPad's retina display. Well, "excited" is not quite the right word. More like "dreading." Because Cond√© iPad magazines actually use images for most of their articles, rather than text. The underlying technology is the charmingly named Adobe Digital Publishing Suite family, which, at root, is basically an image reader. Way back in September, 2010, Cond√© told All Things D: "The goal is to be all HTML, and we will be." Alas, that day has yet to come, as I confirmed when I loaded the latest issue of The New Yorker on my new iPad and immediately saw fuzzy text. Sure, the text-based articles, such as the comment, display beautifully. But longer articles, which are carefully laid out and rendered as images, do not. They look worse than on the old iPad, because the anti-aliasing is even easier to see.




Text content from The New Yorker on the first generation iPad (top) and the third generation iPad with retina display (bottom). Looks great because it's text. Click for larger images.


I complained about this on Twitter, Brian Lam chimed in, and Scott Dadich, Cond√©'s Vice President of Content Innovation, was kind enough to respond:

@theory @blam fret not, gents, we're on it. For a preview, check out our first hires magazine with vector text, Vogue.‚Äî Scott Dadich (@sdadich) March 17, 2012



I suspect that the reality of the overlap of The New Yorker and Vogue readers resembles the Venn diagram to the right. But I want to see The New Yorker rock on the iPad, so I put aside some time to download the new Vogue app and take it for a spin.



First, the good news. I got a free month's subscription and downloaded the latest issue of Vogue, which does indeed have hi-res images. The articles look great. Ads are still low-res, but some might consider that a feature (not, I daresay, the advertisers). Alas, that's where the good news ends. Overall, this app is almost exactly like the The New Yorker app. I find this a little odd, since in print the magazines could not be much less different: The New Yorker is a slim, staple-bound, mostly-text weekly. Vogue is a phone book-sized perfect bound, glossy fashion magazine. Quite different beasts. Business-wise, I can understand why they would be the same: It's less expensive to have a single "media player" for all of your company's periodical properties, and the tablet form factor allows you to eliminate some of the differences. After all, bits don't weigh anything.



Image content from Vogue on the new iPad. Not shown: the second that it's blurry while the image engine finishes loading and displaying the image. Click for larger images.


Except that they do. The Vogue April 2012 issue weighs in at a whopping 408 MB. A special "exclusive download" covering The Met Gala demands 530 MB of disk space. The latter I can kinda/sorta understand, as it contains a bunch of videos (all low-res text and image content, though). The fact that the new issue is so huge tells me that one of two things, or perhaps both, is going on here:


Vogue is such an image-driven magazine that it will just be big no matter what you do.
The text content is still images, just bigger ones.


We'll have to wait for the much less image-driven content of The New Yorker to find out if the its downloads are smaller, but the Vogue example does not make me optimistic.

Worse than the download size, though, is the fact that user-triggered downloads do not happen in the background. I started a download and quit the app, then came back after 15 minutes of doing other stuff, and it had gone nowhere, though it restarted the downloading without me needing to do anything more. This is one of the biggest beefs I've had with The New Yorker app: I have to start a download, and then wait for it to finish, often up to 5 minutes, without being able to do anything else on my iPad. This sucks.

Other issues I have with the Vogue app, and which are also present in the existing The New Yorker app:


When not reading an issue, but looking in the "Store" or "My Account," pages are quite slow to load. They appear to be web views that download content every time they are loaded, with no caching. With hi-res images, it gets even slower. It would be nice if these were cached, so that a new download would happen only if there was actually new content.
Controls can be very slow to respond. I clicked a "Buy Issue" button, and nothing happened for 15 seconds. No activity indicator icon, nothing. Subsequent taps of the button were a bit better, taking only a second or so to respond.
Not all controls are obvious. For example, in "My Account," the "Complete Account Setup" button is slightly darker than the others, so perhaps disabled. But if I tap it, it depresses. But nothing happens. This is quite different from how standard iOS controls work, where if a button is disabled, its color is greatly reduced and tapping it does nothing.
When viewing the high-res magazine, images and text start out low-res, then sharpen. Clearly we are still dealing with image content, even for the text. (Or perhaps PDFs and a slow rendering engine. The rendering reminds me of the iterative`` display of progressive JPEGs on the web in the 90s.)
Some articles have a Chevron icon for different or related content. If you tap one, it jumps to a completely different part of the magazine (think the back pages). There is no back arrow.
I never cared for the swipe left and right to switch articles/ads, swipe up and down for more pages of content. I think it works okay for scrolling apps; Byline works that way, for example. But not so much for pagination. No other reading apps work like that. And since some of the chevron controls also scroll left and right, they seem to behave differently but show the same animation.
Some pages looks as though you ought to be able to tap something, such as an invitation to watch a video or a description of an article (especially in the "In This Issue" section), but nothing happens when you tap. They really ought to respond to taps.
Other places are less obvious that should be tapped for more info, but there are instructions, such as a little circle in the Special Edition that says "tap circle to show caption." I tap the circle and the caption appears, right where the tip had been. Why not just show the caption?
Some articles have sharing features, where you can share via Twitter, Facebook, or email. The Twitter feature connects you to twitter.com in a web view, rather than use the iOS 5 Twitter support. Worse, it does not remember that I logged in between sessions. So if I tweeted yesterday and want to do it again today, I have to log in again. I suspect the Facebook feature works the same. Sharing via Email just opens the Mail app, rather than use the embedded iOS email controller.
When I use the table of contents popover, it is always scrolled to the top, no matter how far down the currently-displayed article is or where I left it the last time I used it.


There are other issues, as well, some minor, such as the boring grey background if you make an image or article bounce when you scroll past the end, or the display of the issue name in the iTunes store as "Vogue Magazine_200_30." Other issues are more annoying, such as the difficulty of discovering and managing the different types and layers of navigation. But honestly, if just the following issues were addressed, the app would be so much better:


Use plain text for layout. HTML would be great.
Get the download size down. Reducing the use of images for laying out text will help a lot for The New Yorker, I'm sure; less perhaps for Vogue.
Allow the downloads to happen in the background, no matter what else I'm doing.
Make less use of embedded web browsers for stuff, or at least cache them. This is a tablet, with a lot of great features built in. Take advantage of them to make the app as responsive as possible!


These steps will help a lot. But even then, I can't help but think that there continues to be more need for UX exploration and experimentation. A tablet is not a magazine and not a web browser, but offers its own features and constraints. I think a better fit for selling editorial or image-based content could still be created; these apps don't come close. I can think of three reasons for why not:


The limitations of the Adobe publishing platform. It's a lowest-common denominator experience, in that the player has to work on a bunch of different devices, and so would suck on all of them. And it just might not have the controls for a strong text-based layout, though I don't see why Adobe wouldn't have the resources to address that issue.
The desire for layout integrity. But as Craig Grannell writes, that's akin to 90s web sites that were nothing but a single big image. It didn't work well for a whole slew of reasons.
Copyright. Plain-text content would just be too easy to "steal," but if it's in a PNG, no one will bother. I know nothing about this personally, but it would not surprise me if there were folks inside Cond√© and some of these other magazines who don't want to use text-based content because it would be too easy to copy.


I find none of these reasons compelling. 

Look, I write this out of love. The New Yorker is my favorite magazine, bar none, and I want it to succeed. Print is dying, but there is so much opportunity on devices like the iPad. Continue to create the best content, and provide it in a form factor and experience that takes advantage of the features and limitations of your targeted platforms, to allow readers to enjoy reading, and success will be assured.

titleDesignScene Has Landed
bodyú-I know I‚Äôve been fairly quiet lately, though for good reasons. One is that I did some of my more recent blogging on the PGXN Blog, though even there it has been a while. The main reason for my silence has been my focus on coding DesignScene, a new app for the iPad that I developed with my friend and partner Roger Wong.

Some history. Early last year I started learning Objective-C to implement an iPhone application. I‚Äôd had a great idea for a simple app to replace SMS, and so set about learning the ropes, and got relatively far in the development of the UI. (Fortunately, borange and atebits released Textie and I was able to kill that project.) As I worked, I started tweeting things about working with Objective-C and cocoa (both completely new experiences for me), and Roger, whom I‚Äôve known since he and Strongrrl were in art school together in the early 90s, and who‚Äôd had an idea of his own, took notice and DMed me about a partnership.

Roger envisioned an application in which he could absorb himself in all the images and feeds he normally explored as part of his everyday work of gathering inspiration as a graphic designer. His initial mockup looked great, and I was immediately drawn to the idea of an app with carefully curated content in a beautiful interface to serve a specific (and design-savvy) niche. We agreed to meet at iPad Dev Camp in April to see if the idea had any legs, and whether we could work well together.



iPad Dev Camp was a great success for us. Jayant Sai was especially helpful, hanging out in the ‚Äúnewbie room‚Äù and pointing out that Roger could work on stuff in Interface Builder while I hacked code. It made it much easier to figure out how we could collaborate (though in fairness Roger has had to wait for me to learn and code a lot of stuff). Bill Dudney was there too, and helped us work out some of the details of animating the browser view. Good stuff. By the time it was over, we had a prototype of the UI nicely working, and even won an honorable mention at the hackathon.

Since then, we‚Äôve had times when I‚Äôve been able to give development more or less time. I spent six weeks over the summer developing the back end in my spare time from my day jobs. The code there regularly harvests from all the feeds we‚Äôve selected, finds good images, extracts summaries, and provides a single, clean feed for DesignScene to consume. This allows the app to sync very quickly, which we felt was important for optimizing the user experience.

And as I worked on the iPad app itself, I‚Äôve learned a lot about real MVC design patterns and development, which is quite different from the stuff we web app developers tend to call MVC. And in the last few months the app really came together, as we started pulling in actual content and applying the fit and finish. And now it‚Äôs here, in the App Store. I‚Äôm so thrilled with how it turned out, so happy to be using it. Hell, it‚Äôs one of the few apps I‚Äôve ever developed that I actually enjoy using on a day-to-day basis. You will too; go get it!

Oh, and just dig the awesome trailer Roger put together. It‚Äôs such a joy to work with someone who knows Photoshop and After Effects like I know Perl and SQL.


	
	
	
	


Since we launched on Tuesday, we‚Äôve been fortunate to receive some really terrific coverage:


Gizzmodo (includes a video of the UI in action)
macstories
Padvance
Shawn Blanc
MacMagazine (Portuguese)



And we‚Äôre not sitting still. I‚Äôm working through a short list of burrs and spurs that need to be polished off, and then moving on to some other great features we have planned. Stay tuned!

title4Getting Postfix to Send Mail From a Comcast Network
bodyåSince I moved to Comcast a while back, I have not received emails from this
blog server telling me that comments have been left. This is a drag because
spam comments can pile up for a while before I think to go looking for them
and delete them. So today I took the time to figure out how to get Postfix to
send mail through the Comcast server. Kudos
to Kclug mail list post by ‚ÄúLucas,‚Äù which
explains the issue in very simple terms. The key is to tell Postfix to relay
mail through the Comcast mail server on port 587 (which is the correct port
for Comcast to use for their users to send mail) and to use your Comcast.net
username and password to connect. So I put this in my main.cf:


relayhost = [smtp.comcast.net]:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl/passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options =


Then, following the instructions
in this Freelock Knowledge Base article, I put this in
my passwd file:


smtp.comcast.net    myusername:some_password


I actually had to contact Comcast to get my username and password, since I
had never used the Comast mail server or other services before. But they gave
it to me without problem. Then I just ran this and was good to go:


chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl/passwd;
chmod 600 /etc/postfix/sasl/passwd
postmap /etc/postfix/sasl/passwd 
postfix reload


And now maybe someone else will stumble upon this blog entry when they're
Googling for a solution and get the help they need, too. No doubt I'll be
looking for it again in a year or so, the way things go.

titleWhere iCal Keeps Invitations
bodyâBI was fiddling with iCalendar invitations yesterday, trying to
get Sandy's .ics files to import into Outlook. I got that
figured out (yes!), but in the meantime iCal started crashing on me. I was
reasonable sure that it was due to a bogus invitation file, but could not for
the life of me figure out where iCal was keeping such files. It just kept
crashing on me as second or so after starting up, every time.

I finally figured it out by quitting all my apps, moving all of the folders
in ~/Library to a temporary folder, and firing up iCal to see what
folds it would create. And there it
was: ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iCal. I quit iCal, deleted the new
folders in ~/Library, moved the originals back, and looked inside the
iCal caches folder to find a bunch of invitation files in
the incoming folder. I deleted them all and iCal fired up again
without a hitch. W00t!

So if you're having problems with iCal crashing and have a few invitations
in it and you're wondering how to get iCal to ignore them, just quit iCal,
delete all of the files
in /Users/yourusername/Library/Caches/com.apple.iCal/incoming, and
start iCal back up again.

And now I'll be able to find this information again when next I need it.

title;Configuring <code>rsnapshot</code> and launchd on Mac OS X
bodyâZJust a few quick notes on how I set up launchd to run rsnapshot to backup my new iMac. The configurations I made are based on Kenn Christ's blog entry.


  
    Installed the rsnapshot port:
    sudo port install rsnapshot
  

  
    Changed /opt/local/etc/rsnapshot.conf as follows:
    
snapshot_root	/Volumes/Demiterra/Backup/
#interval	hourly	6
rsync_long_args	--delete --numeric-ids --relative --delete-excluded -extended-attributes
exclude	*.cpan*
link_dest	1
#backup	/home/		localhost/
#backup	/etc/		localhost/
#backup	/usr/local/	localhost/
backup	/Users/		

    Note that I've commented out hourly backups and the default backup directories. I'm using the Backups subdirectory on a My Book half terrabyte drive that I picked up at Costco for $220. Your configuration may of course differ.
  

  
    Tested it by manually running:
    sudo /opt/local/bin/rsnapshot daily
  

  
    Created hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly launchd plist files for rsnapshot. The hourly one runs every six hours and I threw it in just for completeness. You can download them all from here. Just put them into /Library/LaunchDaemons and run:
    sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.rsnapshot.periodic-*.plist
  


And that's it. Enjoy!categoryComputers | OS | Macosx	timestamp

titleMy Adventures with Mac OS X
bodyÅìK    I recently decided to make the leap from Yellow Dog Linux to
    Mac OS X on my Titanium PowerBook. Getting everything to
    work the way I wanted proved to be a challenge, but well worth it. This
    document outlines all that I learned, so that neither you nor I will have to
    experience such pain again. The overall goal was to get Bricolage up and running,
    figuring that if it worked, then just about any mod_perl based solution
    would run. I'm happy to say that I was ultimately successful. You can be,
    too.

    In the descriptions below, I provide links to download the software
    you'll need, as well as the shell commands I used to compile and install
    each package. In all cases (except for the installation of the Developer
    Tools), I saved each package's sources to /usr/local/src and
    gunzipped and untarred them there. I also carried out each step as root, by
    running
    sudo -s. If you're not comfortable using a Unix shell, you
    might want to read
    up on it, first. All of my examples also assume a sh-compatible shell,
    such as bash or zsh. Fortunately, zsh comes with OS X, so you can just
    enable it for yourself in NetInfo Manager by setting users ->
    <username> -> shell to "/bin/zsh", where <username>
    is your user name.

    Developer Tools
    All of the software that I describe installing below must be compiled. To
    compile software on Mac OS X, you need to install the Mac OS X Developer
    Tools. These provide the cc compiler and many required libraries.
    Conveniently, these come on a CD-ROM with the Mac OS X Version 10.1 upgrade
    kit. I just popped in the CD and installed them like you'd install any other OS X
    software. I needed administrative access to OS X to install the
    Developer Tools (or, indeed, to install any of the other software I describe
    below), but otherwise it posed no problems.

    The best time to install the Developer Tools is immediately after
    upgrading to OS X version 10.1. Then run the Software Update applet in the
    System preferences to get your system completely up-to-date. By the time I
    was done, I had the system updated to version 10.1.3.

    Emacs
    The first step I took in the process of moving to OS X was to get
    working the tools I needed most. Essentially, what this meant was
    GNU Emacs. Now I
    happen to be a fan of the X version of Emacs -- not XEmacs, but GNU Emacs
    with X support built in. I wasn't relishing the idea of having to install X
    on OS X (although there are XFree86
    ports that do this), so I was really pleased to discover the Mac-Emacs project. All I had to
    do was patch the GNU Emacs 21.1 sources and compile them, and I was ready to
    go! GNU Emacs works beautfully with the OS X Aqua interface.

    There were a few configuration issues for me to work out, however. I have
    become addicted to the green background that an old RedHat .XConfig file had
    set, and I wanted this feature in OS X, too. Plus, the default font was
    really ugly (well, too big, really -- anyone know how to make it smaller in
    Emacs?) and the Mac command key was working as the Emacs META key, rather
    than the option key. So I poked around the net until I found the settings I
    needed and put them into my .emacs file:

    (custom-set-faces
'(default ((t (:stipple nil
  :background "DarkSlateGrey"
  :foreground "Wheat"
  :inverse-video nil
  :box nil
  :strike-through nil
  :overline nil
  :underline nil
  :slant normal
  :weight normal
  :height 116
  :width normal
  :family "apple-andale mono"))))
'(cursor ((t (:background "Wheat"))))
; Use option for the meta key.
(setq mac-command-key-is-meta nil)

    Intalling Emacs is not required for installing any of the other packages
    described below -- it just happens to be my favorite text editor and IDE. So
    I don't provide the instructions here; the Mac-Emacs project does a plenty
    good job. If you're not comfortable with Unix editors, you can use whatever
    editor you like. BBEdit is a good
    choice.

    GDBM
    Mac OS X doesn't come with a DBM! But since mod_ssl needs it, we have to
    install it. Fortunately, I found this PDF
    detailing someone else's adventures with mod_ssl on OS X, and it provided
    decent instructions for installing GDBM. First, I created a new user for
    GDBM. In NetInfoManager, I created a duplicate of the "unknown"
    user and named it "bin". Then, I downloaded
    GDBM from the FSF,
    and installed it like this:

  cd /usr/local/src/gdbm-1.8.0
cp /usr/libexec/config* .
./configure
make
make install
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libgdbm.a \
  /usr/local/lib/libdbm.a

    That did the trick. Nothing else was involved, fortunately.

    Expat
    Who doesn't do something with XML these days? If your answer is, "not
    me!", then you'll need to install the Expat library in order to work
    with XML::Parser in Perl. Fortunately it's relatively easy to install,
    although support for the -static flag appears to be broken in cc on OS X, so
    it needs to be stripped out. I downloaded it from its
    project
    page, and then did this:

    cd /usr/local/src/expat-1.95.2
./configure
perl -i.bak -p -e \
  's/LDFLAGS\s*=\s*-static/LDFLAGS=/' \
  examples/Makefile
perl -i.bak -p -e \
  's/LDFLAGS\s*=\s*-static/LDFLAGS=/' \
  xmlwf/Makefile
make
make install

    Perl
    Although Mac OS X ships with Perl (Yay!),
    it's the older 5.6.0 version. There have been many bug fixes included in
    5.6.1, so I wanted to make sure I got the latest stable version before I
    built anything else around it (mod_perl, modules, etc.).

    Being a Unix program, Perl doesn't expect to run into the problems
    associated with a case-insensitive file system like that Mac OS X's HFS
    Plus. So there are a couple of tweaks to the install process that make it
    slightly more complicated than you would typically expect. Fortunately, many
    have preceded us in doing this, and the work-arounds are well-known.
    Basically, it comes down to this:

    cd /usr/local/src/perl-5.6.1/
export LC_ALL=C
export LANG=en_US
perl -i.bak -p -e \
  's|Local/Library|Library|g' hints/darwin.sh
sh Configure -des -Dfirstmakefile=GNUmakefile \
  -Dldflags="-flat_namespace"
make
make test
make install

    There were a few errors during make test, but none of them
    seems to be significant. Hopefully, in the next version of Perl, the build
    will work just as it does on other platforms.

    Downloads
    Before installing Open SSL, mod_ssl, mod_perl, and Apache, I needed to get
    all the right pieces in place. The mod_ssl and mod_perl configure processes
    patch the Apache sources, so the Apache sources have to be downloaded and
    gunzipped and untarred into an adjacent directory. Furthermore, the mod_ssl
    version number corresponds to the Apache version number, so you have to be
    sure that they match up. Normally, I would just download the latest versions
    of all of these pieces and run with it.

    However, Bricolage requires the libapreq library and its supporting
    Perl
    modules to run, and these libraries have not yet been successfully
    ported to Mac OS X. But worry not; fearless mod_perl hackers are working on
    the problem even as we speak, and there is an interim solution to get
    everything working.

    As of this writing, the latest version of Apache is 1.3.24. But because I
    needed libapreq, I had to use an experimental version of Apache
    modified to statically compile in libapreq. Currently, only version 1.3.23
    has been patched for libapreq, so that's what I had to use. I discovered
    this experimental path thanks to a discussion
    on the Mac OS X
    Perl mail list.

    So essentially what I did was download the experimental apache.tar.gz and the
    experimental lightweight apreq.tar.gz packages
    and gunzip and untar them into /usr/local/src. Then I was ready to move on
    to Open SSL, mod_ssl, and mod_perl.
    
    Open SSL
    Compiling Open SSL was pretty painless. One of the tests fails, but it all
    seems to work out, anyway. I download the sources from the Open SSL site, and did this:

  cd /usr/local/src/openssl-0.9.6c
./config
make
make test

    mod_ssl

    The mod_ssl Apache module poses no problems whatsoever. I simply downloaded
    mod_ssl-2.8.7-1.3.23 from the mod_ssl
    site (note that the "1.3.23" at the end matches the version of Apache I
    downloaded) and gunzipped and untarred it into /usr/local/src/. Then I
    simply excuted:

    ./configure \
  --with-apache=/usr/local/src/apache_1.3.23

    mod_perl
    Configuring and installing mod_ssl was, fortunately, a relatively
    straight-forward process. Getting Apache compiled with mod_perl and mod_ssl,
    however, was quite tricky, as you'll see below. A number of braver folks
    than I have preceeded me in installing mod_perl, so I was able to rely on
    their hard-earned knowledge to get the job done. For example, Randal
    Schwartz
    posted
    instructions to the mod_perl mail
    list, and his instructions worked well for me. So I downloaded the
    sources from the mod_perl site, and
    did this:

    cd /usr/local/src/mod_perl-1.26
perl Makefile.PL \
  APACHE_SRC=/usr/local/src/apache_1.3.23/src \
  NO_HTTPD=1 \
  USE_APACI=1 \
  PREP_HTTPD=1 \
  EVERYTHING=1
make
make install

    Apache
    Getting Apache compiled just right was the most time-consuming part of this
    process for me. Although many had gone before me in this task, everybody
    seems to do it differently. I had become accustomed to just allowing Apache
    to use most of its defaults when I compiled under Linux, but now I was
    getting all kinds of errors while following different instructions from
    different authorities from around the web. Sometimes Apache wouldn't compile
    at all, and I'd get strange errors. Other times it would compile, pass all
    of its tests, and install, only to offer up errors such as

    dyld: /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd Undefined symbols:
_log_config_module

    when I tried to start it. It turns out that the problem there was that I
    had a number of modules compiled as DSOs -- that is, libraries that can be
    loaded into Apache dynamically -- but wasn't loading them properly in my
    httpd.conf. This was mainly because I've grown accustomed to Apache having
    all the libraries I needed compiled in statically, so I simply didn't have
    to worry about them.

    But I finally hit on the right incantation to get Apache to compile with
    everything I need added statically, but still with support for DSOs by
    compiling in mod_so. I present it here for your viewing pleasure:

    SSL_BASE=/usr/local/src/openssl-0.9.6c/ \
    ./configure \
    --with-layout=Apache \
    --enable-module=ssl \
    --enable-module=rewrite \
    --enable-module=so \
    --activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a \
    --disable-shared=perl \
    --without-execstrip
  make
  make certificate TYPE=custom 
  make install

    This series of commands successfully compiled Apache with mod_perl and
    mod_ssl support statically compiled in, along with most of the other default
    modules that come with Apache. In short, everything is there that you need
    to run a major application with security such as Bricolage.

    Note that make certificate will lead you through the process
    of creating an SSL certificate. I like to use the "custom" type so
    that it reflects the name of my organization. But you can use whatever
    approach you're most comfortable with. Consult the mod_ssl INSTALL
    file for more information.

    libapreq
    Once Apache is installed with mod_perl and mod_ssl, the rest is gravy! The
    experimental libapreq library I downloaded installed without a hitch:

    cd /usr/local/src/httpd-apreq
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

    PostgreSQL
    PostgreSQL is a sophisticated
    open-source Object-Relational DBMS. I use it a lot in my application
    development, and it, too, is required by Bricolage. I was a bit concerned
    about how well it would compile and work on Mac OS X, but I needn't have
    worried. First of all, Apple has
    provided some pretty decent instructions.
    Although they mainly document how to install MySQL, a competing open-source RDBMS, many
    of the same concepts apply to PostgreSQL.

    The first thing I had to do was to create the "postgres" user.
    This is the sytem user that PostgreSQL typically runs as. I followed Apple's
    instructions, using NetInfo Manager to duplicate the default "www"
    group and "www" user and give the copies the name
    "postgres" and a new gid and uid, respectively.

    Next I downloaded the PostgreSQL version 7.2.1 sources. Version 7.2 is
    the first to specifically support Mac OS X, so going about the install was
    as simple as it is on any Unix system:

    ./configure --enable-multibyte=UNICODE
make
make install

    That was it! PostgreSQL was now installed. Next I had to initialize
    the PostgreSQL database directory. Again, this works much the same as it does
    on any Unix system:

    sudo -u postgres /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb \
  -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

    The final step was to start PostgreSQL and try to connect to it:

    sudo -u postgres /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl start \
  -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -U postgres template1

    If you follow the above steps and find yourself at a psql prompt, you're
    in business! Because I tend to use PostgreSQL over TCP, I also enabled TCP
    conntectivity by enabling the "tcpip_socket" option in the
    postgresql.conf file in the data directory created by initdb:

    tcpip_socket = true

    If you're like me, you like to have servers such as PostgreSQL start when
    your computer starts. I enabled this by creating a Mac OS X PostgreSQL
    startup bundle. It may or may not be included in a future version of
    PostgreSQL, but in the meantime, you can download it from here. Simply download it, gunzip and untar
    it into /Library/StartupItems, restart OS X, and you'll see it start up
    during the normal Mac OS X startup sequence. I built this startup bundle by
    borrowing from the existing FreeBSD PostgreSQL startup script, the Apache
    startup script that ships with OS X, and by reading the Creating
    SystemStarter Startup Item Bundles HOWTO.

    XML::Parser At this point, I had most
    of the major pieces in place, and it was time for me to install the Perl
    modules I needed. First up was XML::Parser. For
    some reason, XML::Parser can't find the expat libraries, even though the
    location in which I installed them is pretty common. I got around this by
    installing XML::Parser like this:

    perl Makefile.PL EXPATLIBPATH=/usr/local/lib \
  EXPATINCPATH=/usr/local/include
make
make test
make install

    Text::Iconv
    In Bricolage, Text::Iconv does
    all the work of converting text between character sets. This is because all
    of the data is stored in the database in Unicode, but we wanted to allow
    users to use the character set with which they're accustomed in the UI. So I
    needed to install Text::Iconv. Naturally, Mac OS X doesn't come with
    libiconv -- a library on which Text::Iconv depends -- so I had to install
    it. Fortunately, it was a simple process to download it and do a normal
    build:

    cd /usr/local/src/libiconv-1.7
./configure
make
make install

    Now, Text::Iconv itself was a little more problematic. You have to tell
    it to look for libiconv by adding the -liconv option to the LIBS key in
    Makefile.PL. I've simplified doing this with the usual Perl magic:

    perl -i.bak -p -e \
  "s/'LIBS'\s*=>\s*\[''\]/'LIBS' => \['-liconv'\]/" \
  Makefile.PL
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


    DBD::Pg
    Although the DBI
    installed via the CPAN module without problem, DBD::Pg wanted to play
    a little less nice. Of course I specified the proper environment varibles to
    install it (anyone know why DBD::Pg's Makefil.PL script can't try to figure
    those out on its own?), but still I got this error during make:

    /usr/bin/ld: table of contents for archive:
/usr/local/pgsql/lib/libpq.a is out of date;
rerun  ranlib(1) (can't load from it)

    But this was one of those unusual situations in which the error message
    was helpful. So I took the error message's advice, and successfully compiled
    and installed DBD::Pg like this:

ranlib /usr/local/pgsql/lib/libpq.a
export POSTGRES_INCLUDE=/usr/local/pgsql/include
export POSTGRES_LIB=/usr/local/pgsql/lib
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

    LWP
    The last piece I needed to worry about customizing when I installed it was
    LWP. Before
    installing, back up /usr/bin/head. The reason for this is that LWP will
    install /usr/bin/HEAD, and because HFS Plus is a case-insensitive file system,
    it'll overwrite /usr/bin/head! This is a pretty significant issue, since
    many configure scripts use /usr/bin/head. So afert installing LWP, move
    /usr/bin/HEAD, GET, & POST to /usr/local/bin. Also move /usr/bin/lwp* to
    /usr/local/bin. Then move your backed-up copy of head back to /usr/bin.

    Naturally, I didn't realize that this was necessary until it was too
    late. I installed LWP with the CPAN module, and it wiped out /usr/bin/head.
    Fortunately, all was not lost (though it took me a while to figure out why
    my Apache compiles were failing!): I was able to restore head by copying it
    from the Mac OS X installer CD. I Just poped it in an executed the
    command:

    cp "/Volumes/Mac OS X Install CD/usr/bin/head" \
  /usr/bin

    And then everything was happy again.

    Bricolage

    And finally, the pi√®ce de r√©sistance: Bricolage! All of the other
    required Perl modules installed fine from
    Bundle::Bricolage:

    perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Bricolage'

    Then I simply followed the directions in Bricolage's INSTALL file, and
    started 'er up! I would document those steps here, but the install process
    is currently in flux and likely to change soon. The INSTALL file should
    always be current, however -- check it out!

    To Be Continued
    No doubt my adventures with Unix tools on Mac OS X are far from over. I've
    reported to various authors on the issues I've described above, and most
    will soon be releasing new versions to address those issues. As they do,
    I'll endeavor to keep this page up-to-date. In the meantime, I am thoroughly
    enjoying working with the first really solid OS that Apple has released in
    years, and thrilled that I can finally have the best of both worlds: a good,
    reliable, and elegant UI, and all the Unix power tools I can stand! I hope
    you do, too.

And I had this problem with CDs burned by Tiger, too, last summer, so it's not

title@Byline: A Case Study Apple and Google Philosophical Differences
body™>My favorite iPhone feed reading app is Byline by Phantom Fish. It syncs really well with Google Reader, so that things stay more-or-less in sync with NetNewsWire on my Mac. Unlike NetNewsWire, which added Google Reader syncing in 2009, Byline was built with Google Reader syncing from the beginning. Version 3.0 is especially good; I love the ability to swipe between posts. And the killer feature is the archiving of all content after a sync, so that everything loads fast ‚Äî or on cross-country flights. News junkie that I am, Byline is one of my most-used apps.



Another great feature is Byline‚Äôs edit mode. When looking at a long list of
new posts in a particular feed (for me it most often happens with the CPAN
Uploads feed ‚Äî CPAN gets a lot of
uploads every day!), most of which I don‚Äôt care to read, I tap the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù
button to enter edit mode and then start tapping the blue dots to mark a whole
bunch of items as unread. But not all of them; I leave the ones I‚Äôd like to
read. But there‚Äôs a problem. At the top of the screen, directly above the top
read/unread toggle button, is a button labeled ‚ÄúMark All as Read.‚Äù As soon as
you tap this button, Byline exits edit mode and shifts back to the main
screen.

It‚Äôs a handy shortcut if you actually want to mark all as read. But what if
you accidentally hit it, as I‚Äôve done, oh, 20 or 30 times? Well, easy, right? Just go back into that feed, enter edit mode again, and then go over the list again and mark those you still want to read as unread, right? Yes, except for one thing: if Byline syncs before you‚Äôve had a chance to read those posts you‚Äôve just marked as unread, they automatically get marked as unread again.
If you‚Äôve elected to include unread items in Byline (it‚Äôs a setting), you can‚Äôt tell which ones were magically marked as unread by the sync. And if you don‚Äôt have unread items included in Byline, those items are just gone.

This has annoyed me many times.

In fairness, it‚Äôs not entirely Byline‚Äôs fault. One of its design philosophies is to use the Google API eagerly. So as soon as you‚Äôre done reading something, it‚Äôs marked as read, whether or not the app is actively syncing to Google Reader. This is handy because it means as soon as I‚Äôve read something, if I sync NetNewsWire on my desktop, it‚Äôs marked as read there, too. It minimizes the appearance of duplication.



One of the APIs it calls ASAP is Google Reader‚Äôs ‚ÄúMark All as Read API call‚Äù, and as Phantom Fish has said, Google provides no way to un-do that call. The result, for me at least, and certainly other users, is the loss of unread items.

I‚Äôve had an interesting Twitter conversation with Phantom Fish about this issue this morning, trying to brainstorm ways to work around it. For me, I‚Äôd like to see either a confirmation button when I hit ‚ÄúMark All as Read,‚Äù or have it not immediately leave edit mode but turn the ‚ÄúMark All as Read‚Äù button into an ‚ÄúUndo‚Äù button, so that I have a chance to undo the marking all as read while still in edit mode, before the API call gets sent to Google. Phantom Fish is understandably reluctant to make a change such as this, however, because so many people like and have requested the single-tap to mark all as read. There are users who want both things. And Phantom Fish is reluctant to add a setting for such a feature, and indeed, I also tend to favor convention over configuration.




It‚Äôs a bit of a thorny issue, but one that I think nicely highlights the philosophical difference between Apple and Google. On iOS, I‚Äôm used to nothing I do while in an edit mode being committed until I hit the ‚ÄúDone‚Äù button. Byline‚Äôs ‚ÄúMark All as Read‚Äù button short-circuits this behavior by ending the editing without me hitting ‚ÄúDone,‚Äù and instantly calls the Reader API. This is very convenient for power users (who never hit the ‚ÄúMark All as Read‚Äù button accidentally, I guess), and strongly reminds me of how Geek-oriented Google applications like Reader are. I‚Äôm guessing such power users are Google Reader users. I‚Äôm not, I just use it for syncing.

The emphasis of ‚ÄúMark all as Read‚Äù and its underlying API is ro ‚Äúget things done in as few steps as possible.‚Äù This contrasts with the Apple philosophy exhibited in iOS, where things should of course be done as efficiently as possible, but where, I think, the principle of least surprise is emphasized. It‚Äôs handy to mark all as read with one tap, unless you didn‚Äôt want to, in which case it‚Äôs surprising that you can‚Äôt get the unread items back‚Äîspecially since you never told the app you were done editing. Google Reader power-user types want the convenience of one tap. Folks like me, used to the relatively low levels of the unexpected on iOS, want things to change only when we say we‚Äôre ready for the change.

Anyway, I expect that Phantom Fish will work out some way to deal with this issue. (Frankly, I‚Äôd welcome the ability to exclude certain feeds from Byine, as NetNewsWire for iOS does, so that I don‚Äôt have to bother with some feeds on my iPhone, but that‚Äôs a different feature request.) But I thought it was interesting, in discussing the issue, how UI philosophical interests can conflict. Frankly, I think that iOS apps should be more iOSy in this respect (in all other ways Byline is very iOSy), but others disagree, and it makes for an interesting conversation.

title8How to Integrate the TestFlight SDK into an iOS Project
bodyùbI've started using TestFlight to release DesignScene betas to testers. The documentation is thin, so I had to futz a bit, but fortunately it's a pretty simple app, so once I figured out that I just needed to stick to one "Team", I was off and running. And let me tell you, TestFlight is a far easier way to distribute betas than the convoluted methods suggested by Apple. Much more beta user-friendly.

For us developers, the TestFlight SDK is particularly handy. Add it to your TestFlight-distributed project and get crash reports and remote logging, ask your testers for feedback, and other cool stuff. I've only just started using it, but the immediate diagnostic feedback has already proved invaluable.

Getting the TestFlight SDK to work is dead simple, but it's not supported in App Store distributions. So I wanted to set things up so that it would always be included in beta releases and never in production releases. Getting to that point took a couple of days of futzing, as it's not explicitly supposed by Xcode's UI. The solution I came up with, thanks to this StackOverflow post, is to:


Add a "Beta" configuration to complement the default "Release" and "Debug" configurations
Add a preprocessor macro to allow conditional use of the TestFlight SDK
Use the EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES setting to exclude the TestFlight library from "Release" builds


That last step makes me a bit nervous, but EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES, while undocumented, seems to be reasonably well known. At any rate, I could find no better way to tie the inclusion of a library to a specific configuration, so I'm going with it. Better solutions welcome.

At any rate, here's the step-by-step for Xcode 4.2:


Download the TestFlight SDK and unpack it.
Drag it into your project. Make sure that "Copy items into destination group's folder" is checked, as is "Create groups for any added folders". Include it in all relevant targets.
Create a "Beta" configuration:


Click on the app name in the navigator, then on the project name and then the info tab.
Under "Configurations", click the plus sign and select "Duplicate "Release" Configuration"
Type "Beta" to name the new configuration.


You should end up with something like this:



Create configuration marcos:




Still in the project settings, go to the "Build Settings" tab.
Search for "preprocessor macros".
Double-click the value section next to the "Preprocessor Macros" label, hit the + button, and enter CONFIGURATION_$(CONFIGURATION).


You should end up with a window like the above. Once you close it, you should see the macros names for each individual configuration, shown here:


Add the EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES build setting.


Still in the "Build Settings" tab, click the "Add Build Setting" button in the lower-left corner and select "Add User-Defined Setting".
Input EXCLUDED_SOURCE_FILE_NAMES as the name of the setting.
Open the reveal triangle next to the setting name.
Double-click to the right of "Release".
Enter *libTestFlight.a as the value.


You should end up with the value *libTestFlight.a only for the "Release" configuration, as shown here:


Go ahead and use the TestFlight SDK:


In your app delegate, add #include "testFlight.h"
In -application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:, just before returning, add these lines:

#ifdef CONFIGURATION_Beta
    [TestFlight takeOff:@"Insert your Team Token here"];
#endif



Now, when you build or archive with the "Beta" target, the TestFlight SDK will be included and log sessions. But when you build with the "Release" target, TestFlight will neither be bundled or referenced in the app. You can include it anywhere, though, and use any of its features, as long as you do so only within a #ifdef CONFIGURATION_Beta block. Check out the complete SDK docs for details. Then, get your beta on!

bodyàrWell, I got no responses to my request for assistance setting up NTPD on FreeBSD, but today I must've just been Googling better, because I found the resources I needed.

The most important site I found was the NTP configuration page from Computer Facilities Management at the University of Washington. It was valuable because it provided some simple ntpd.conf file samples that set up ntpd to run only as a client. So no I'm confident that no one will try to connect to my servers and cause any mischief. The CFM NTP page also helpfully pointed out that I could easily enable ntpd on my Red Hat box by typing chkconfig ntpd on.

Another interesting site I found is www.pool.ntp.org. The cool thing about using pool.ntp.org as the time server to synchronize my servers to is that it distributes the load to lots of time servers. So I set up my ntpd.conf files to point first to pool.ntp.org, and then to two geographically close servers.

And finally, this DynDNS page gave me the instruction I needed to get ntpd running on FreeBSD. All I had to do was add xntpd_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf. I restarted my box, and now I'm in business!

title$Lessons Learned with Perl and UTF-8
bodyΩI learned quite a lot last week as I was making Bricolage much more
Unicode-aware. Bricolage has always managed Unicode content and stored it in a
PostgreSQL Unicode-encoded database. And by Unicode I of course
mean UTF-8. By far the biggest nightmare was figuring out 
the bug
with Apache::Util::escape_html(), but ultimately it came down
to an interesting lesson.

Why was I making Bricolage Unicode-aware? Well, it all started with a
bug report from
Kang-min Liu (a.k.a. Gugod). I had na√Øvely thought that if strings
were Unicode that Perl would know it and do the right thing. It turns out I
was wrong. Perl assumes that everything is binary unless you tell it
otherwise. This means that Perl operators such as length
and substr will count bytes instead of characters. And in the
case of Unicode, where characters can be multiple bytes, this can cause
serious problems. Not only were strings improperly concatenated mid-character
for Gugod, but PostgreSQL could refuse to accept such strings, since a chopped-up multibyte
character isn't valid Unicode!

So I had to make some decisions: Either stop using Perl operators that
count bytes, or let Perl know that all the strings that Bricolage deals with
are Unicode strings. The former wasn't really an option, of course, since
users can specify that certain content fields be a certain length of
characters. So with a lot of testing help from Gugod and his Bricolage install
full of multibyte characters, I set about doing so. The result is in the
recently released Bricolage 1.8.2 and I'm blogging what I learned for both
your reference and mine.

Perl considers its internal representation of strings to be UTF-8 strings,
and it knows what variables contain valid UTF-8 strings because they have a
special flag set on them, called, strangely enough, utf8. This
flag isn't set by default, but can be set in a number of ways. The ways I've
found so far are:


  Using Encode::decode() to decode a string from binary to
    Perl's internal representation. The use of the word decode here had
    confused me for a while, because I thought it was a special encoding. But
    the truth is that it's not. Strings can have any number of encodings, such
    as ISO-8859-1, GB3212, EUC-KR, UTF-8, and the
    like. But when you decode a string, you're telling Perl that it's
    not any of those encodings, but Perl's own representation. I was confused
    because Perl's internal representation is UTF-8, which is an encoding. But
    really it's not UTF-8, It's utf8, which isn't an encoding, but
    Perl's own thing.

  Cheat: Use Encode::_set_utf8_on(). This private function
      is nevertheless documented by the Encode
      module, and therefore usable. What it does is simply turn on the
      utf8 flag on a variable. You need be confident that the
      variable contains only valid UTF-8 characters, but if it does, then you
      should be pretty safe.

  Using the three-argument version of open, such as

    open my $fh, "<utf8", "/foo/bar"
  or die "Cannot open file: $!\n"
    
    Now when you read lines from this file, they will automatically be
      decoded to utf8.

  Using binmode to set the mode on a file handle:

    binmode $fh, ":utf8";

    As with the three-argument version of open this forces
      Perl to decode the strings read from the file handle.

  use utf8;. This Perl pragma indicates that everything
      within its scope is UTF-8, and therefore should be decoded
      to utf8.


So I started applying these approaches in various places. The first thing I
did was to set the utf8 flag on data coming from the browser with
Encode::_set_utf8_on(). Shitty browsers can of course send shitty
data, but I'm deciding, for the moment at least, to trust browser to send only
UTF-8 when I tell them that's what I want. This solved Gugod's immediate
problem, and I happily closed the bug. But then he started to run into places
where strings appeared properly in some places but not in others. We spent an
entire day (night for Gugod--I really appreciated the help!) tracking down the
problem, and there turned out to be two of them. One was the the bug
with Apache::Util::escape_html() that I've described
elsewhere, but the other proved more interesting.

It seems that if you concatenate a UTF-8 string with the utf8
flagged turned on with a UTF-8 string without utf8 turned on, the
text in the unflagged variable turns to crap! I have no idea why this is, but
Gugod noticed that strings pulled into the UI from the Bricolage zh_tw
localization library simply didn't display properly. I had him add use
utf8; to the zh_tw module, and the problem went away!

So the lesson learned here is: If you're going to make Perl strings
Unicode-aware, then all of your Perl strings need to be
Unicode-aware. It's an all or nothing kind of thing.

So while setting the utf8 flag on browser submits and
adding use utf8; to the localization modules got us part of the
way toward a solution, it turned out to be trickier than I expected to get
the utf8 flag set on everything. The places I needed to get it
working were in the UI Mason components, in templates, and in strings pulled
from the database.

It took a bit of research, but I think I successfully figured out how to
make the UI Mason components UTF-8 aware. I just added preamble =>
"use utf8\n;" to the creation of the Mason interpretor. This
gets passed on to is compiler, and now that string is added to the beginning
of every template. This made things behave better in the UI. I applied the
same approach to the interpetor created for Mason templates with equal
success.

I'm less confident that I pulled it off for the HTML::Template and Template
Toolkit templating architectures. In a discussion on the templates mailing
list, Andy Wardley suggested that it wasn't currently possible.
But I wasn't so sure. It seemed to me that, since Bricolage reads in the
templates and asks TT to execute them within a certain scope, that I could
just set the mode to utf8 on the file handle and then execute the
template within the scope of a use utf8; statement. So that's
what I did. Feedback on whether it works or not would be warmly welcomed.

I tried a similar approach with the HTML::Template burner. Again, the
burner reads the templates from files and passes them to HTML::Template for
execution (as near as I could tell, anyway; I'm not an HTML::Template template
user). Hopefully it'll just work.

So that just left the database. Since the database is Unicode-only, all I
needed to do was to turn on the utf8 flag for all content pulled
from the database. Amazingly, this hasn't come up as an issue for people very
much, because DBI doesn't do anything about Unicode. I picked up an older discussion started by Matt Sergeant on
the dbi-dev mail list, but it looks like it might be a while before DBI has
fast, integrated support for turning utf8 on and off for various
database handles and columns. I look forward to it, though, because it's
likely to be very efficient. I greatly look forward to seeing the results
of Tim's work in the next release of DBI. I opened
another bug report to remind myself to take
advantage of the new feature when it's ready.

So in the meantime, I needed to find another solution. Fortunately, my
fellow PostgreSQL users had run into it before, and added what I needed to DBD::Pg
back in version 1.22. The pg_enable_utf8 database handle
parameter forces the utf8 flag to be turned on for all string
data returned from the database. I added this parameter to Bricolage, and now
all data pulled from the database is utf8. And so are the UI
components, templates, localization libraries, and data submitted from
browsers. I think that nailed everything, but I know that Unicode issues
are a slippery slope. I can't wait until I have to deal with them again!

Not.

title&FSA::Rules Graphing Features Improved
bodyâ*

I just released FSA::Rules 0.25. This version came about as I
returned to the module to handle setting up a PostgreSQL database and found
the graphics that it churned out, well, wanting. I wanted a decision tree, but
the graphics just had the names of the states for the nodes, and then long
question-like labels on the edges. What I wanted instead was for each node to
be a question (or a statement about what the node was doing), and for the
edges to be simple answers to those questions (or indicators as to the success
of the code run in a state).

So I added a new attribute to the state class, label. You can
use this attribute to say something more about the state. In my case, I used
it to store the question the state asks, or the description of the state's
activities. I then changed the code that creates the graph to use this
attribute in preference to the state name when creating node labels. The
result is a much more natural decision graph, as you see here

The release features a number of other goodies, including the elimination
of a dependence on the Clone module, and thus also a big memory
savings. There is now a lot more control over the format of graphs, too.
Enjoy!

titleEncoding is a Headache
bodyèI have to spend way too much of my programming time worrying about character encodings. Take my latest module, Text::Markup for example. The purpose of the module is very simple: give in the name of a file, and it will figure out the markup it uses (HTML, Markdown, Textile, whatever) and return a string containing the HTML generated from the file. Simple, right?

But, hang on. Should the HTML it returns be decoded to Perl‚Äôs internal form? I‚Äôm thinking not, because the HTML itself might declare the encoding, either in a XML declaration or via something like

<meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html;charset=Big5" />


And as you can see, it‚Äôs not UTF-8. So decoded it would be lying. So it should be encoded, right? Parsers like XML::LibXML::Parser are smart enough to see such declarations and decode as appropriate.

But wait a minute! Some markup languages, like Markdown, don‚Äôt have XML declarations or headers. They‚Äôre HTML fragments. So there‚Äôs no wait to tell the encoding of the resulting HTML unless it‚Äôs decoded. So maybe it should be decoded. Or perhaps it should be decoded, and then given an XML declaration that declares the encoding as UTF-8 and encoded it as UTF-8 before returning it.

But, hold the phone! When reading in a markup file, should it be decoded before it‚Äôs passed to the parser? Does Text::Markdown know or care about encodings? And if it should be decoded, what encoding should one assume the source file uses? Unless it uses a BOM, how do you know what its encoding is?

Text::Markup is a dead simple idea, but virtually all of my time is going into thinking about this stuff. It drives me nuts. When will the world cease to be this way?

Oh, and you have answers to any of these questions, please do feel free to leave a comment. I hate having to spend so much time on this, but I‚Äôd much rather do so and get things right (or close to right) than wrong.

titlePod: Now with Sane Web Links
bodyé<A couple months ago, RJBS and I collaborated on adding a new feature to Pod: ">sane URL links. For, well, ever, the case has been that to link to URLs or any other scheme: links in Pod, You had to do something like this:


For more information, consult the pgTAP documentation:
L<http://pgtap.projects.postgresql.org/documentation.html>


The reasons why you couldn't include text in the link to server as the link text has never been really well spelled-out. Sean Burke, the most recent author of the Pod spec, had only said that the support wasn't there "for various reasons."

Meanwhile, I accidentally discovered that Pod::Simple has in fact supported such formats for a long time. At some point Sean added it, but didn't update the spec. Maybe he thought it was fragile. I have no idea. But since the support was already there, and most of the other Pod tools already support it or want to, it was a simple change to make to the spec, and it was released in Perl 5.11.3 and Pod::Simple 3.11. It's now officially a part of the spec. The above Pod can now be written as:


For more information, consult the L<pgTAP
documentation|http://pgtap.projects.postgresql.org/documentation.html>.


So much better! And to show it off, I've just updated all the links in SVN::Notify and released a new version. Check it out on CPAN Search. See how the links such as to "HookStart.exe" and "Windows Subversion + Apache + TortoiseSVN + SVN::Notify HOWTO" are nice links? They no longer use the URL for the link text. Contrast with the previous version.

And as of yesterday, the last piece to allow this went into place. Andy gave me maintenance of Test::Pod, and I immediately released a new version to allow the new syntax. So update your t/pod.t file to require Test::Pod 1.41, update your links, and celebrate the arrival of sane links in Pod documentation.

title4Keep DBI's connect_cached From Horking Transactions
body©"I've been on a bit of a Perl hacking tear lately. In addition to knocking out
Test::XPath last week, I've been experimenting with
TAP::Harness sources,
Template::Declare, Catalyst views, a new
Module::Build subclass for building database-backed
applications, and, last but not least, an
IRC
logging bot. Oh, and that application I'm working on
for PGX with Quinn
Weaver. So much is crowding my mind these days that I'm having trouble
sleeping. Tonight I'm up late hacking to try to get some of this stuff out of
my head.

But before I crash, I wanted to share a useful DBI hack. I use
connect_cached in a lot of my applications, because it's a
nice way to reuse database handles without having to figure out my own caching
algorithm. The code I have to use it looks like this:


sub dbh {
    my $self = shift;
    DBI->connect_cached( @{ $self->_dbi }{qw(dsn username password)}, {
        PrintError     => 0,
        RaiseError     => 0,
        HandleError    => Exception::Class::DBI->handler,
        AutoCommit     => 1,
    });
}


Very simple. I just call the dbh() method whenever I need to
talk to the database, and I'm set. Except for one problem: transactions.

Say I have a method that grabs the handle, starts a transaction with
the begin_work method, and then inserts a row. Then another
method grabs the handle from dbh() on the assumption that it's in
the same transaction, and does its own work. Only, it's not the same
transaction, because, unfortunately, DBI sets the attributes passed
to connect_cached every single time it's called!. So
even though that second method may think it's in the middle of a transaction,
it's really not, because when connect_cached
sets AutoCommit back to 1, the transaction gets committed.

Oops.

This really fucks with my tests, where I'm often fetching the database
handle to start a transaction, running some tests, and then wanting to
rollback the transaction when I'm done. It's irritating as all hell to
discover that data has been inserted into the database. And the DBI, alas,
just gives me this warning:


rollback ineffective with AutoCommit enabled at t/botinst.t line 67.


I'm likely not to notice until I get a duplicate key error the next time I
run the tests.

As I was dealing with this today, my memory started poking at me, telling
me that I've dealt with this before. And sure enough, a quick Google shows
that Tim Bunce and I
had an extensive conversation
on this very topic -- over four years ago. If you're patient enough
to dig through that thread, you'll note that this issue is due to some
architectural difficulties in the DBI, to be worked out in DBI 2.

Over the last four years, I've implemented a couple of solutions to this
problem, all involving my code tracking the transaction state and modifying
the AutoCommit attribute in the appropriate places. It's all
rather fragile. But as I dug through the thread, I discovered a much cleaner
fix, using a little-known and so-far undocumented feature of the DBI:
callbacks. This is actually I feature I half-way implemented
in the DBI years ago, getting it just far enough that Tim was willing to
finish it. And it's just sitting there, waiting to be used.

So here's the trick: Specify a callback for
the connect_cached() method that's used only when an existing
file handle is retrieved from the cache. A bunch of stuff is passed to the
callback, but the important one is the fifth argument, the attributes. All it
has to do is delete the AutoCommit attribute. Since this callback
is called before the DBI looks at the attributes to set them on the handle,
the callback effectively prevents the DBI from horking up your
transactions.

Here's the modified code:


my $cb = {
    'connect_cached.reused' => sub { delete $_[4]->{AutoCommit} },
};

sub dbh {
    my $self = shift;
    DBI->connect_cached( @{ $self->_dbi }{qw(dsn username password)}, {
        PrintError     => 0,
        RaiseError     => 0,
        HandleError    => Exception::Class::DBI->handler,
        AutoCommit     => 1,
        Callbacks      => $cb,
    });
}


Callbacks are passed as a hash reference, with the keys being the names of
the DBI methods that should trigger the callbacks, such as ping,
data_sources, or connect_cached. The values are, of
course, code references. When the DBI calls the code callbacks, it passes in
stuff relevant to the method.

In the case of connect_cached, there are two additional
special-case callbacks, connect_cached.new and
connect_cached.reused, so that you can have different callbacks
execute depending on whether connect_cached used a cached
database handle or had to create a new one. Here, I've
used connect_cached.reused, of course, and all I do is kill off
the AutoCommit attribute before the DBI gets its greedy hands on
it. Et voil√†, problem solved!

And before you ask, no, you can't simply omit AutoCommit
from the attributes passed to connect_cached, because the DBI
helpfully adds it for you.

So now this is here so I can find it again when it bites me next year, and
I hope it helps you, too. Meanwhile, perhaps someone could take it upon
themselves to document DBI's callbacks? At this point, the closest thing to
documentation is in the
tests. (Hrm. I think I might have had a hand in
writing them.) Check 'em out.

title)Issues Parsing Markdown with HOP::Parser
body∑Since I had some ideas for features to add on
to Markdown, and
since I have been wanting to learn more about parsing, I picked up my copy
of Higher-Order Perl with the aim of
writing a proper parser for Markdown. I've made a decent start, with support
for simple paragraphs, code spans, escapes, and a few other things. Then I
took on emphasis spans and ran smack into the limits of the current implementation of
HOP::Parser.

It started out simply enough. I added this tokens to my lexer:


        [ EMOP => qr/[_]{1,2}|[*]{1,2}/ ],


The Markdown
syntax calls for emphasized text to be bracketed one star or underscore,
and strong text to be bracketed by two stars or underscores. With this simple
‚Äúemphasis operator‚Äù token, I was able to write an emphasis parser like
this:


my $joiner  = sub { join '', @_ };
my $sstar   = absorb match EMOP => '*';
my $suscore = absorb match EMOP => '_';
my $not_em;
my $Not_em = parser { $not_em->(@_) };

my $emphasis = T(
    alternate(
        concatenate( $sstar,   $Not_em, $sstar   ),
        concatenate( $suscore, $Not_em, $suscore ),
    ),
    sub { "<em>$_[0]</em>" }
);

# omitted: definition of $strong;

$not_em = T(plus( T( alternate(
    $text, $code, $strong
), $joiner, ) ), $joiner);


(The plus() parser is
in my fork of HOP::Parser
on GitHub.) The parser for <strong> is similar. And it
works reasonably well for simple examples such as:


  *this*
  _this_
  un*frigging*believable
  un_frigging_believable
  *this* and *that*
  *this* and _that_


It even works when strong and emphasis are mixed:


  ‚Äú***this***‚Äù yields <strong><em>this</em></strong>
  ‚Äú___this___‚Äù yields <strong><em>this</em></strong>
  ‚Äú*this **and** that*‚Äù yields <em>this <strong>and</strong> that</em>
  ‚Äú*this __and__ that*‚Äù yields <em>this <strong>and</strong> that</em>


But then came the need to support properly parsing non-emphasizing instances of the emphasis characters. For example, each of these should yield no emphasis:


  * not em *
  _ not em _


Instead, they should be parsed as literal stars and underscores. This is
because opening emphasis operators must be followed by a non-space character,
and closing ones must be preceded by a non-space character. So my first
thought was to use lookahead and lookbehind in the parser to find left and
right emphasis operators, like so:


        [ EMLOP => qr/(?<=[^\s_])[_]{1,2}|(?<=[^\s*])[*]{1,2}/ ],
        [ EMROP => qr/[_]{1,2}(?=[^\s_])|[*]{1,2}(?=[^\s*])/ ],


And then I changed the parser to this:


my $lstar  = absorb match EMLOP => '*';
my $rstar  = absorb match EMROP => '*';
my $lscore = absorb match EMLOP => '_';
my $rscore = absorb match EMROP => '_';

my $emphasis = T(
    alternate(
        concatenate( $lstar,  $Not_em, $rstar  ),
        concatenate( $lscore, $Not_em, $rscore ),
    ),
    sub { "<em>$_[0]</em>" }
);


Again, this works with the simple examples, but now I'm getting different
issues. For example, whereas ‚Äú__*word*__‚Äù should be lexed as


[
  ['EMLOP,   '__'  ],
  ['EMLOP',  '*'   ],
  ['STRING', 'this'],
  ['EMROP',  '*'   ],
  ['EMROP,   '__'  ],
]


But instead comes out as:


[
  ['STRING', '__'  ],
  ['EMROP',  '*'   ],
  ['STRING', 'this'],
  ['EMROP',  '*'   ],
  ['STRING', '__'  ],
]


Note that it's not finding any left operators there! There are a number of
examples where the lexed tokens are just inadequate, leading to parse
failures.

The whole problem with identifying the left and right emphasis operators is
where they are relative to whitespace or line boundaries. Even trickier,
however, is the mid-word emphasis, such as in ‚Äúun*frigging*believable,‚Äù where,
to know whether an operator is left or right, you have to actually be tracking
whether or not a left one has been found. For example, if you find a star,
it's a rightop if a previously-found leftop star was found; otherwise it's a
leftop. So the issue is state, which of course the Lexer cannot track (once
you capture a token, it's gone; you can't do a lookbehind).

So I thought that the solution would be to start generating whitespace
tokens. It's likely I'd have to do this anyway, to deal with code blocks and
lists, though I had hoped to avoid it even then, since it means a lot
more tokens and a lot more work for the lexer. But I decided to give it a try.
I changed the relevant bits of the lexer to:


        [ SPACE => qr/[\t ]+/ ],
        [ EMOP  => qr/[_]{1,2}|[*]{1,2}/ ],


(I'm ignoring newlines because they're already handled elsewhere in the
lexer.) This at least makes the lexing much simpler, and there are no
unexpected tokens. With that, I went about trying to coerce the parser to
properly deal with those tokens:


my $space     = match 'SPACE';
my $neg_space = neg_lookahead $space;
my $sstar     = absorb match EMOP => '*';
my $suscore   = absorb match EMOP => '_';
my $not_em;
my $Not_em = parser { $not_em->(@_) };

my $emphasis = T(
    alternate(
        concatenate( $sstar,   $neg_space, $Not_em, $sstar   ),
        concatenate( $suscore, $neg_space, $Not_em, $suscore ),
    ),
    sub { "<em>$_[0]</em>" }
);


That neg_lookahead() parser-builder was my attempt to
implement a negative lookahead assertion. This is so that the left emphasis
operator is only identified as such if it is not followed by
a space. It looks like this:


sub neg_lookahead {
    my $p = ref $_[0] eq 'CODE' ? shift : lookfor @_;
    parser {
        my $input = shift or return;
        my @ret = eval { $p->($input) };
        return @ret ? () : (undef, $input);
    },
}


I also had to change my $text parser, which is included
in $not_em, to recognize EMOP tokens and stringify them, since
they can now sometimes be ignored by the emphasis parser. Still, this doesn't
quite get me where I want to be. For example, ‚Äú*this*‚Äù is not interpreted as
having any emphasis at all. The reason? because the $not_em
parser now recognizes EMOP tokens, and it's a greedy parser. So while the
parser does fine the first star and the intervening text, it fails to find the
second star, because the $not_em parser has already eaten it!

At this point, I'm pretty frustrated. I really want to get this right, but
I'm at the limits of both what I understand about parsing and, I think, the
current implementation of HOP::Parser (which has no way to turn off
greediness, as far as I know). At first I thought that adding backtracking as
described in section 8.8
of Chapter 8 might help, but I couldn't figure out how to add it
to HOP::Parser without fundamentally changing how the parser works. But then I
realized that it wouldn't be able to backtrack to find the last token eaten by
the $text parser anyway, so the issue is moot.

What I really need is some help better understanding how to think about
parsing stuff like this. It took me years to really understand regular
expressions, so I don't doubt that it will take me a long time to train my
mind to think like a parser, but hints and suggestions would be greatly
appreciated!

If you're curious enough, the code, in progress,
is here.

titleHandling Multiple Exceptions
bodyñI ran into an issue with DBIx::Connector tonight: SQLite started throwing an exception from within a call to rollback(): ‚ÄúDBD::SQLite::db rollback failed: cannot rollback transaction ‚Äì SQL statements in progress‚Äù. This is rather annoying, as it ate the underlying exception that led to the rollback.

So I've added a test to DBIx::Connector that looks like this:

my $dmock = Test::MockModule->new($conn->driver);
$dmock->mock(rollback => sub { die 'Rollback WTF' });

eval { $conn->txn(sub {
    my $sth = shift->prepare("select * from t");
    die 'Transaction WTF';
}) };

ok my $err = $@, 'We should have died';
like $err, qr/Transaction WTF/, 'Should have the transaction error';


It fails as expected: the error is ‚ÄúRollback WTF‚Äù. So far so good. Now the question is, how should I go about fixing it? Ideally I'd be able to access both exceptions in whatever exception handling I do. How to go about that?

I see three options. The first is that taken by Bricolage and DBIx::Class: create a new exception that combines both the transaction exception and the rollback exception into one. DBIx::Class does it like this:

$self->throw_exception(
  "Transaction aborted: ${exception}. "
  . "Rollback failed: ${rollback_exception}"
);


That‚Äôs okay as far as it goes. But what if $exception is an Exception::Class::DBI object, or some other exception object? It would get stringified and the exception handler would lose the advantages of the object. But maybe that doesn‚Äôt matter so much, since the rollback exception is kind of important to address first?

The second option is to throw a new exception object with the original exceptions as attributes. Something like (pseudo-code):

DBIx::Connector::RollbackException->new(
    txn_exception      => $exception,
    rollback_exception => $rollback_exception,
);


This has the advantage of keeping the original exception as an object, although the exception handler would have to expect this exception and go digging for it. So far in DBIx::Connector, I've left DBI exception construction up to the DBI and to the consumer, so I'm hesitant to add a one-off special-case exception object like this.

The third option is to use a special variable, @@, and put both exceptions into it. Something like:

@@ = ($exception, $rollback_exception);
die $rollback_exception;


This approach doesn‚Äôt require a dependency like the previous approach, but the user would still have to know to dig into @@ if they caught the rollback exception. But then I might as well have thrown a custom exception object that‚Äôs easier to interrogate than an exception string. Oh, and is it appropriate to use @@? I seem to recall seeing some discussion of this variable on the perl5-porters mail list, but it‚Äôs not documented or supported. Or something. Right?

What would you do?

bodyçHI get email:


  Hey David,
  
  I ran in to an issue earlier today in production that, while it is an error in my code, DBIx::Connector could easily handle the issue better.  Here's the use case:


package Con;
use Moose;
sub txn {
    my ($self, $code) = @_;
    my @ret;
    warn "BEGIN EVAL\n";
    eval{ @ret = $code->() };
    warn "END EVAL\n";
    die "DIE: $@" if $@;
    return @ret;
}
package main;
my $c = Con->new();
foreach (1..2) {
    $c->txn(sub{ next; });
}

  
  The result of this is:


BEGIN EVAL
Exiting subroutine via next at test.pl line 16.
Exiting eval via next at test.pl line 16.
Exiting subroutine via next at test.pl line 16.
BEGIN EVAL
Exiting subroutine via next at test.pl line 16.
Exiting eval via next at test.pl line 16.
Exiting subroutine via next at test.pl line 16.

  
  This means that any code after the eval block is not executed.  And, in the case of DBIx::Connector, means the transaction is not commited or rolled back, and the next call to is txn() mysteriously combined with the previous txn() call.  A quick fix for this is to just add a curly brace in to the eval:


eval{ { @ret = $code->() } };

  
  Then the results are more what we'd expect:


BEGIN EVAL
Exiting subroutine via next at test.pl line 16.
END EVAL
BEGIN EVAL
Exiting subroutine via next at test.pl line 16.
END EVAL

  
  I've fixed my code to use return; instead of next;, but I think this would be a useful fix for DBIx::Connector so that it doesn't act in such an unexpected fashion when the developer accidentally calls next.


The fix here is pretty simple, but I'm not sure I want to get into the business of defending against programmer mistakes like this in DBIx::Connector or any module.

What do you think?

Anyway, a problem I'm currently working on is finding a word in a list of words that's the closest match to another word. Text::Levenshtein appears to be a good method to determine relative closeness, but try as I might, I couldn't make it work using first or min or apply or any of the utility list methods.

Anyone got any bright ideas? This is a reasonably well-known technique, so I'm sure that I must be overlooking something obvious.

title"Stepped Series of Numbers in Perl
bodyàIn working on a Perl validation function for GTINs
(recipe here), I found a need to generate a
series of numbers with a step of two. For example, I in the series 1-10, I
first want 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. And then later I want 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. Here's how
I went about creating those series in my GTIN function to create hash
slices:


sub isa_gtin {
    my @nums = reverse split q{}, shift;
    (
        sum( @nums[ grep {   $_ % 2  } 0..$#nums ] ) * 3
      + sum( @nums[ grep { !($_ % 2) } 0..$#nums ] )
    ) % 10 == 0;
}


But it seems wasteful to generate the series of numbers twice and to
calculate whether they're odd or even twice. Surely there's a more efficient
way to do this in Perl, perhaps even more expressive? Python seems to have a
useful syntax for creating array slices that step. In Python, I'd do something
like this:


  sum( nums[1:10:2] ) * 3 + sum( nums[2:10:2])


But barring such a slice feature in Perl is there some cleaner way than the
ugly grep approach I created to generate a stepped series in
Perl?

titleTest XML and HTML with XPath
body”/When I was hacking Rails projects back in 2006-2007, there was a lot of
stuff about Rails that drove me absolutely batshit
(<cough>ActiveRecord</cough>), but there were also a (very) few
things that I really liked. One of those things was
the assert_select
test method. There was a bunch of magic involved in sending a request to your
Rails app and stuffing the body someplace hidden (hrm, that sounds kind of
evil; intentional?), but then you could call assert_select to use
CSS selectors to test the structure and content of the document (assuming, of
course, that it was HTML or XML). For example, (to borrow from the Rails
docs), if you wanted to test that a response contains two ordered lists, each
with four list elements then you'd do something like this:


assert_select "ol" do |elements|
  elements.each do |element|
    assert_select element, "li", 4
  end
end


What it does is select all of the <ol> elements and pass
them to the do block, where you can
call assert_select on each of them. Nice, huh? You can also
implicitly call assert_select on the entire array of passed
elements, like so:


assert_select "ol" do
  assert_select "li", 8
end


Slick, right? I've always wanted to have something like this in Perl, but
until last week, I didn't really have an immediate need for it. But I've
started on a Catalyst project with my partners
at PGX, and of course I'm using a view to generate XHTML output. So I
started asking around for advice on proper unit testing for Catalyst views.
The answer I got was,
basically, Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst. But I found it insufficient:


$mech->get_ok("/");
$mech->html_lint_ok( "HTML should be valid" );
$mech->title_is( "Root", "On the root page" );
$mech->content_contains( "This is the root page", "Correct content" );


Okay, I can check the title of the document directly, which is kind of
cool, but there's no other way to examine the structure? Really? And to check
the content, there's just content_contains(), which concatenates
all of the content without any tags! This is useful for certain very simple
tests, but if you want to make sure that your document is properly structured,
and the content is in all the right places,
you're SOL.

Furthermore, the html_link_ok() method didn't like the Unicode
characters output by my view:


#   Failed test 'HTML should be valid (http://localhost/)'
#   at t/view_TD.t line 30.
# HTML::Lint errors for http://localhost/
#  (4:3) Invalid character \x2019 should be written as &rsquo;
#  (18:5) Invalid character \xA9 should be written as &copy;
# 2 errors on the page


Of course, those characters aren't invalid, they're perfectly good UTF-8
characters. In some worlds, I suppose, they should be wrong, but I actually
want them in my document.

So I switched to Test::XML, which uses a proper XML parser to
validate a document:


ok my $res = request("http://localhost:3000/"), "Request home page";
ok $res->is_success, "Request should have succeeded";

is_well_formed_xml $res->content, "The HTML should be well-formed";


Cool, so now I know that my XHTML document is valid, it's time to start
examining the content and structure in more detail. Thinking fondly on
assert_select, I went looking for a test module that uses XPath
to test an XML document, and
found Test::XML::XPath right in the Test::XML
distribution, which looked to be just what I wanted. So I added it to my test
script and added this line to test the content of
the <title> tag:


is_xpath $res->content, "/html/head/title", "Welcome!";


I ran the test‚Ä¶and waited. It took around 20 seconds for that test to run,
and then it failed!


#   Failed test at t/view_TD.t line 25.
#          got: ''
#     expected: 'Welcome!'
#   evaluating: /html/head/title
#      against: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
# <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
#  <head>
#   <title>Welcome!</title>
#  </head>
# </html>


No doubt the alert among my readership will spot the problem right away,
but I was at a loss. Fortunately, Ovid was over for dinner last week, and he
pointed out that it was due to the namespace. That is, the xmlns
attribute of the <html> element requires that one register
a namespace prefix to use in the XPath expression. He pointed me to his fork
of XML::XPath,
called Test::XHTML::XPath, in
his Escape project. It mostly duplicates Test::XML::XPath, but contains
this crucial line of code:


$xpc->registerNs( x => "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" );


By registering the prefix ‚Äúx‚Äù for the XHTML namespace, he's able to write
tests like this:


is_xpath $res->content, "/x:html/x:head/x:title", "Welcome!";


And that works. It seems that the XPath
spec requires that one use prefixes
when referring to elements within a namespace. Test::XML::XPath, alas,
provides no way to register a namespace prefix.

Perhaps worse is the performance problem. I discovered that if I stripped
out the DOCTYPE declaration from the XHTML before I passed it
to is_xpath, the test was lightning fast. Here the issue is
that XML::LibXML, used by Test::XML::XPath, is fetching the DTD from the
w3.org Web site as the test runs. I can disable this by setting
the no_network and recover_silently XML::LibXML
options, but, again, Test::XML::XPath provides no way to do so.

Add to that the fact that Test::XML::XPath has no interface for recursive
testing like assert_select and I was ready to write my own
module. One could perhaps update Test::XML::XPath to be more flexible, but for
the fact that it falls back
on XML::XPath when it can't find XML::LibXML, and XML::XPath, alas,
behaves differently than XML::LibXML (it didn't choke on my lack of a
namespace prefix, for example). So if you ship an application that uses
Test::XML::XPath, tests might fail on other systems where it would use a
different XPath module than you used.

And so I have written a new test module.

Introducing Test::XPath, your Perl module for flexibly
running XPath-powered tests on the content and structure of your XML and HTML
documents. With this new module, the test for my Catalyst application
becomes:


my $tx = Test::XPath->new( xml => $res->content, is_html => 1 );
$tx->is("/html/head/title", "Welcome", "Title should be correct" );


Notice how I didn't need a namespace prefix there? That's because
the is_html parameter coaxes XML::LibXML into using its HTML
parser instead of its XML parser. One of the side-effects of doing so is that
the namespace appears to be assumed, so I can ignore it in my tests. The HTML
parser doesn't bother to fetch the DTD, either. For tests where you really
need namespaces, you'd do this:


my $tx = Test::XPath->new(
    xml     => $res->content,
    xmlns   => { x => "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" },
    options => { no_network => 1, recover_silently => 1 },
);
$tx->is("/x:html/x:head/x:title", "Welcome", "Title should be correct" );


Yep, you can specify XML namespace prefixes via the xmlns
parameter, and pass options to XML::LibXML via the options
parameter. Here I've shut off the network, so that XML::LibXML prevents
network access, and told it to recover silently when it tries to fetch the
DTD, but fails (because, you know, it can't access the network). Not bad,
eh?

Of course, the module provides the usual array
of Test::More-like test methods, including ok(),
is(), like() and cmp_ok(). They all
work just like in Test::More, except that the first argument must be an XPath
expressions. Some examples borrowed from the documentation:


$tx->ok( '//foo/bar', 'Should have bar element under foo element' );
$tx->ok( 'contains(//title, "Welcome")', 'Title should "Welcome"' );

$tx->is( '/html/head/title', 'Welcome', 'Title should be welcoming' );
$tx->isnt( '/html/head/link/@type', 'hello', 'Link type should not' );

$tx->like( '/html/head/title', qr/^Foobar Inc.: .+/, 'Title context' );
$tx->unlike( '/html/head/title', qr/Error/, 'Should be no error in title' );

$tx->cmp_ok( '/html/head/title', 'eq', 'Welcome' );
$tx->cmp_ok( '//story[1]/@id', '==', 1 );


But the real gem is the recursive testing feature of the ok()
test method. By passing a code reference as the second argument, you can
descend into various parts of your XML or HTML document to test things more
deeply. ok() will pass if the XPath expression argument selects
one or more nodes, and then it will call the code reference for each of those
nodes, passing the Test::XPath object as the first argument. This is a bit
different than assert_select, but I view the reduced magic as a
good thing.

For example, if you wanted to test for the presence
of <story> elements in your document, and to test that each
such element had an incremented id attribute, you'd do something
like this:


my $i = 0;
$tx->ok( '//assets/story', sub {
    shift->is('./@id', ++$i, "ID should be $i in story $i");
}, 'Should have story elements' );


For convenience, the XML::XPath object is also assigned to $_
for the duration of the call to the code reference. Either way, you can
call ok() and pass code references anywhere in the hierarchy. For
example, to ensure that an Atom feed has entries and that each entry has a
title, a link, and a very specific author element with name, uri, and email
subnodes, you can do this:


$tx->ok( '/feed/entry', sub {
    $_->ok( './title', 'Should have a title' );
    $_->ok( './author', sub {
        $_->is( './name',  'Larry Wall',       'Larry should be author' );
        $_->is( './uri',   'http://wall.org/', 'URI should be correct' );
        $_->is( './email', 'perl@example.com', 'Email should be right' );
    }, 'Should have author elements' );
}, 'Should have entry elements' );


There are a lot of core XPath functions you can use, too. For example,
I'm going to write a test for every page returned by my application to make
sure that I have the proper numbers of various tags:


$tx->is('count(/html)',     1, 'Should have 1 html element' );
$tx->is('count(/html/head') 1, 'Should have 1 head element' );
$tx->is('count(/html/body)  1, 'Should have 1 body element' );


I'm going to use this module to the hilt in all my tests for HTML and XML
documents from here on in. The only thing I'm missing
from assert_select is that it supports CSS 2 selectors, rather
than XPath expressions, and
the implementation offers quite a few other
features including regular expression operators for matching attributes,
pseudo-classes, and other fun stuff. Still, XPath gets me all that I need; the
rest is just sugar, really. And with the ability to
define custom XPath functions
in Perl, I can live without the extra sugar.

Maybe you'll find it useful, too.

titleSplitting Words in Perl
bodyéUI've created a new module, Text::WordDiff, now on its way to CPAN, to show the differences between two documents using words as tokens, rather than lines as Text::Diff does. I plan to use it in Bricolage to give people a change tracking-type view (as seen in word processors) comparing two versions of a document. Fortunately, Algorithm::Diff makes this extremely easy to do. My only real problem was figuring out how to tokenize a string into words

After looking at discussions in The Perl Cookbook and Mastering Regular Expressions, I settled on using Friedl's pattern for identifying the starting boundary of words, which is qr/(?<!\w)(?=\w)/msx. This pattern will turn the string, this is O'Reilly's string into the following tokens:


[
    q{this },
    q{is },
    q{O'},
    q{Reilly'},
    q{s },
    q{string},
];


So it's imperfect, but it works well enough for me. I'm thinking of using the Unicode character class for words, instead, at least for more recent versions of Perl that understand them (5.8.0 and later?). That would be /(?<!\p{IsWord})(?=\p{IsWord})/msx. The results using that regular expression are the same.

But otherwise, I'm not sure whether or not this is the best approach. I think that it's good enough for the general cases I have, and the matching of words in and of themselves is not that important. What I mean is that, as long as most tokens are words, it's okay with me if some, such as O', Reilly', and s  in the above example, are not words. What I don't know is how well it'll work for non-Roman glyphs, such as in Japanese or Korean text. I tried a test on a Korean string I have lying around (borrowed from the Encode.pm test suite), but it didn't split it up at all (with use utf8;).

So what do you think? Does Text::WordDiff work for your text? Is there a better and more general solution for tokenizing the words in a string?

titleFuck Typing LWP
bodyöI'm working on a project that fetches various files from the Internet via LWP. I wanted to make sure that I was a polite user, such that my app would pay attention to Last-Modified/If-Modified-Since and ETag/If-None-Match headers. And in most contexts I also want to respect the robots.txt file on the hosts to which I'm sending requests. So I was very interested to read chromatic‚Äôs hack for this very issue. I happily implemented two classes for my app, MyApp::UA, which inherits from LWP::UserAgent::WithCache, and MyApp::UA::Robot, which inherits from MyApp::UA but changes LWP::UserAgent::WithCache to inherit from LWP::UARobot:


@LWP::UserAgent::WithCache::ISA = ('LWP::RobotUA');


So far so good, right? Well, no. What I didn‚Äôt think about, stupidly, is that by changing LWP::UserAgent::WithCache‚Äôs base class, I was doing so globally. So now both MyApp::UA and MyApp::UA::Robot were getting the LWP::RobotUA behavior. Urk.

So my work around is to use a little fuck typing to ensure that MyApp::UA::Robot has the robot behavior but MyApp::UA does not. Here‚Äôs what it looks like (BEWARE: black magic ahead!):


package MYApp::UA::Robot;

use 5.12.0;
use utf8;
use parent 'MyApp::UA';
use LWP::RobotUA;

do {
    # Import the RobotUA interface. This way we get its behavior without
    # having to change LWP::UserAgent::WithCache's inheritance.
    no strict 'refs';
    while ( my ($k, $v) = each %{'LWP::RobotUA::'} ) {
        *{$k} = *{$v}{CODE} if *{$v}{CODE} && $k ne 'new';
    }
};

sub new {
    my ($class, $app) = (shift, shift);
    # Force RobotUA configuration.
    local @LWP::UserAgent::WithCache::ISA = ('LWP::RobotUA');
    return $class->SUPER::new(
        $app,
        delay => 1, # be very nice -- max one hit per minute.
    );
}


The do block is where I do the fuck typing. It iterates over all the symbols in LWP::RobotUA, inserts a reference to all subroutines into the current package. Except for new, which I implement myself. This is so that I can keep my inheritance from MyApp::UA intact. But in order for it to properly configure the LWP::RobotUA interface, new must temporarily fool Perl into thinking that LWP::UserAgent::WithCache inherits from LWP::RobotUA.

Pure evil, right? Wait, it gets worse. I've also overridden LWP::RoboUA‚Äôs host_wait method, because if it‚Äôs the second request to a given host, I don‚Äôt want it to sleep (the first request is for the robots.txt, and I see no reason to sleep after that). So I had to modify the do block to skip both new and host_wait:


    while ( my ($k, $v) = each %{'LWP::RobotUA::'} ) {
        *{$k} = *{$v}{CODE} if *{$v}{CODE} && $k !~ /^(?:new|host_wait)$/;
    }


If I ‚Äúoverride‚Äù any other LWP::RobotUA methods, I'll need to remember to add them to that regex. Of course, since I'm not actually inheriting from LWP::RobotUA, in order to dispatch to its host_wait method, I can‚Äôt use SUPER, but must dispatch directly:


sub host_wait {
    my ($self, $netloc) = @_;
    # First visit is for robots.txt, so let it be free.
    return if !$netloc || $self->no_visits($netloc) < 2;
    $self->LWP::RobotUA::host_wait($netloc);
}


Ugly, right? Yes, I am an evil bastard. ‚ÄúFuck typing‚Äù is right, yo! At least it‚Äôs all encapsulated.

This just reinforces chromatic‚Äôs message in my mind. I'd sure love to see LWP reworked to use roles!

bodyå1So SVN::Notify doesn't currently run on Windows. Why not? Well, because I wanted to do things as rightly as possible. In terms of efficiency, what that meant was, rather than slurping in whole chunks of data, such as diffs, from svnlook, I instead follows the guidance in perlipc to open a file handle pipe to svnlook and then read from it line-by-line. The method I wrote to create the pipe looks like this:


sub _pipe {
    my ($self, $mode) = (shift, shift);
    # Safer version of backtick (see perlipc(1)).
    local *PIPE;
    my $pid = open(PIPE, $mode);

    if ($pid) {
        # Parent process. Return the file handle.
        return *PIPE;
    } else {
        # Child process. Execute the commands.
        exec(@_) or die "Cannot exec $_[0]: $!\n";
        # Not reached.
    }
}


The problem is that it doesn't work on Windows. perlipc says:


  Note that these operations are full Unix forks, which means they may not be correctly implemented on alien systems. Additionally, these are not true multithreading. If you'd like to learn more about threading, see the modules file mentioned below in the SEE ALSO section.


'Course, the SEE ALSO section doesn't have much of for alien systems, but I have a comment in my code that suggests that Win32::Process might do for Windows compatibility. But I honestly don't know.

So what's the best approach for me to port SVN::Notify to Windows while keeping file handle pipes around for efficiency? Anyone care to take a stab at it, with tests for Winows, and send me a patch?

title&Checkout and Build Perl 5.10 from Git
body®OTonight we had
a Portland
Perl Mongers Perl 5.10 code sprint. This was the first time I've ever
worked with the Perl 5 core code, and while things weren't exactly intuitive,
it wasn't bad to get started, either. I already had a clone of the Perl Git
repository, so here's what I did to get started.

Here's how to clone the Git repository, and then check out the maint-5.10
branch and build and test Perl:


git clone git://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git
cd perl
git checkout -b maint-5.10 origin/maint-5.10
sh Configure -Ode \
 -DDEBUGGING \
 -Dprefix=/usr/local/perl/blead \

 -Dlibpth='/usr/local/lib /usr/lib' \
 -Uversiononly \
 -Uinstallusrbinperl $@
make
make test


I had two test failures:


#   at ../lib/ExtUtils/CBuilder/t/00-have-compiler.t line 39.
#          got: '0'
#     expected: '1'
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 4.
FAILED at test 4


And:


#   at pod/pod2usage2.t line 235.
# Got:
# #Usage:
# #    This is a test for CPAN#33020
# #
# #Usage:
# #    And this will be also printed.
# #
# 


So the first thing I want to do is fix those failures. It took a bit of
fiddling to figure out how to get it to run a single test. On the advice of
Paul Fenwick and Schwern, I tried:


./perl -Ilib lib/ExtUtils/CBuilder/t/00-have-compiler.t


But then the test passed! So something has to be different when running
under make test. With help from Duke Leto, I finally figured
out the proper incantation:


make test TEST_FILES=../lib/ExtUtils/CBuilder/t/00-have-compiler.t


So the TEST_FILES option tells make test what
tests to run, relative to the t/ directory. Shortly thereafter,
Schwern told me about:


cd t
./perl TEST ../lib/ExtUtils/CBuilder/t/00-have-compiler.t


Which is nice, because it does a lot less work.

Now I was ready to figure out the ExtUtils::CBuilder bug and fix it. This
is good, I thought, because ExtUtils::CBuilder is a Perl module, and while my
C is teh suck, my Perl skillz are mad. So I do some poking around, and finally
pinned down the failure to the
have_compiler() method in ExtUtils::CBuilder::Base. A bit more
poking and I had the error printed out:


# error building /tmp/compilet-1529033816.o from '/tmp/compilet-1529033816.c'
at ../../ExtUtils/CBuilder/Base.pm line 110.


Well fuck, that sure looks like a C problem. But then I added some more
debugging code to see what command it's actually running, and from where. So I
added this code:


use Cwd;
print STDERR "# CWD: ", getcwd, $/;
print STDERR "# ", join( ' ', @cc, @flags), $/;


And then I got this output:


# CWD: /Users/david/dev/perl/lib/ExtUtils/CBuilder
# ./perl -e1 -- -I/Users/david/dev/perl/perl -c -fno-common -DPERL_DARWIN -no-cpp-precomp -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fstack-protector -I/usr/local/include -O3 -o ./compilet-892348855.o


And of course, there's no perl in lib/ExtUtils/CBuilder. Why
does it think there is? The test file has this code:


$b->{config}{cc} = "$^X -e1 --";
$b->{config}{ld} = "$^X -e1 --";


Well, that cinches it. $^X is the path to the
currently-executing Perl, but in core--for me at least--that's a relative
path. The test changes directories away from that path, and so it can't find
it. So I just needed to get it to use the proper Perl. Frankly, this test
should fail on every platform that runs it, so I'm not sure how it got
committed to the maint-5.10 branch, but here we are.

So I moved up use File::Spec; and
assigned File::Spec->rel2abs($^X) to a variable before
the chdir, and used that variable for the cc mock.
And that was it, the test passed. Yay!

Now it was time to submit a patch to p5p. I committed the fix to my local
clone, and then, with help from Jacob, generated a patch with git
format-patch -1. The -1 means just a single commit, which
is all I'd committed. This generated a file,
named 0001-Fixed-failing-test-for-ExtUtils-CBuilder.patch. I
edited it to add a comment to the effect that the patch is targeted at the
maint-5.10 branch.

Next Jacob helped me get git configured to send mail through
my gmail account. I just added these lines to ~/.gitconfig:


[sendemail]
        smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
        smtpserverport = 587
        smtpuser = justatheory
        smtppass = idontthinkso!
        smtpencryption = tls


I then sent the patch with:


git send-email --to perl5-porters@perl.org 0001-Fixed-failing-test-for-ExtUtils-CBuilder.patch


And that was it! You can see the result
here.
I started to fiddle with the pod2usage failure, but it was a bit
obscure for me. Perhaps next time.

And speaking of next time, I'm forking the Perl repository on GitHub, and
will probably start to use my own repository for stuff (if it can be kept up
to date; RJBS points out that it's currently way behind the core repo). I'll
likely also create a topic branch before fixing a bug, and then send the patch
from there. That way, when it's committed to the remote branch in core, I
won't have to rebase my local copy: I can just delete the topic branch. This
is a nice way to track individual bug fixes that I've worked on, while letting
the maint-5.10 branch just track the core repository, with no local
changes.

title.Regular Expressions are Faster than Unpacking
bodyê~Bricolage has always used unpack() to parse ISO-8601 date strings into their component parts. A few months back, I added support for subsecond precision using the DateTime, and couldn't figure out how to parse out the optional subsecond part of the date (If it's 0, PostgreSQL doesn't include the decimal part of the seconds). So I switched to parsing with the regular expression /(\d\d\d\d).(\d\d).(\d\d).(\d\d).(\d\d).(\d\d)(\.\d*)?/. This worked well, but I lamented the loss of performance of unpack(). I mean, surely it's faster to tell a parser where, exactly, to find each characters, than it is to use a pattern, right?

Well, last week I finally figured out how to unpack the decimal place using unpack() whether it's there or not (the secret is the * modifier, which somehow I'd never noticed before). So I ran a benchmark to see how much of a performance gain I would get:


#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use Benchmark;

my $date = '2005-03-23T19:30:05.1234';
my $ISO_TEMPLATE =  'a4 x a2 x a2 x a2 x a2 x a2 a*';

sub with_pack {
    my %args;
    @args{qw(year month day hour minute second nanosecond)}
      = unpack $ISO_TEMPLATE, $date;
    {
        no warnings;
        $args{nanosecond} *= 1.0E9;
    }
}

sub with_regex {
    $date =~ m/(\d\d\d\d).(\d\d).(\d\d).(\d\d).(\d\d).(\d\d)(\.\d*)?/;
    my %args = (
        year       => $1,
        month      => $2,
        day        => $3,
        hour       => $4,
        minute     => $5,
        second     => $6,
        nanosecond => $7 ? $7 * 1.0E9 : 0
    );
}

timethese(100000, {
    pack => \&with_pack,
    regex => \&with_regex
});

__END__


I quickly got my answer (all hail Benchmark!). This script outputs:


  Benchmark: timing 100000 iterations of pack, regex...
        pack:  3 wallclock secs ( 2.14 usr +  0.00 sys =  2.14 CPU) @ 46728.97/s (n=100000)
       regex:  3 wallclock secs ( 2.11 usr +  0.01 sys =  2.12 CPU) @ 47169.81/s (n=100000)


I sure didn't expect them to be so close, let alone to see the regular expression approach nose out the unpack() solution. Clearly the Perl regex engine is highly optimized. And perhaps  pack()/unpack() is not.

Live and learn, I guess.

title)Test Everything with TAP Source Handlers
body∫I've just arrived in Japan with my family. We're going to be spending several days in Tokyo, during which time I'll be at the JPUG 10th Anniversary PostgreSQL Conference for a couple of days (giving the usual talk), but mainly I'll be on vacation. We'll be visiting Kyoto, too. We're really excited about this trip; it'll be a great experience for Anna. I'll be back in the saddle in December, so for those of you anxiously awaiting the next installment of my Catalyst tutorial, I'm afraid you'll have to wait a bit longer.

In the meantime, I wanted to write about a little something that's been cooking for a while. Over the last several months, Steve Purkis has been working on a new feature for TAP::Parser: source handlers. The idea is to make it easier for developers to add support for TAP emitters other than Perl. The existing implementation did a decent job of handling Perl test scripts, of course, and executable files (useful for compiled tests in C using libtap, for example), but anything else was difficult.

As the author of pgTAP, I was of course greatly interested in this work, because I had to bend over backwards to get pg_prove to work nicely. It's even uglier to get a Module::Build-based distribution to run pgTAP and Perl tests all at once in during ./Build test: You had to subclass Module::Build to do it.

Steve wanted to solve this problem, and he did. Then he was kind enough to listen to my bitching an moaning and rewrite his fix so that it was simpler for third parties (read: me) to add new source handlers. What's a source handler, you ask? Check out the latest dev release of Test::Harness and you'll see it: TAP::Parser::SourceHandler. As soon as Steve committed it, I jumped in and implemented a new handler for pgTAP. The cool thing is that it took me only three hours to do, including tests. And here's how you use it in a Build.PL, so that you can have pgTAP tests named *.pg run at the same time as your *.t Perl tests:


Module::Build->new(
    module_name        => 'MyApp',
    test_file_exts     => [qw(.t .pg)],
    use_tap_harness    => 1,
    tap_harness_args   => {
        sources => {
            Perl  => undef,
            pgTAP => {
                dbname   => 'try',
                username => 'postgres',
                suffix   => '.pg',
            },
        }
    },
    build_requires     => {
        'Module::Build'                      => '0.30',
        'TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::pgTAP' => '3.19',
    },
)->create_build_script;


To summarize, you just have to:


Tell Module::Build the extensions of your test scripts (that's qw(.t .pg) here)
Specify the Perl source with its defaults (that's what the undef does)
Specify the pgTAP options (database name, username, suffix, and lots of other potential settings)


And that's it. You're done! Run your tests with the usual incantation:


perl Build.PL
./Build test


You can use pgTAP and its options with prove, too, via the --source and  --pgtap-option options:


prove --source pgTAP --pgtap-option dbname=try \
                     --pgtap-option username=postgres \
                     --pgtap-option suffix=.pg \
                     t/sometest.pg


It's great that it's now so much easier to support pgTAP tests, but what if you want to have Ruby tests? Or PHP? Well, it's a simple process to write your own source handler. Here's how:


Subclass TAP::Parser::SourceHandler. The final part of the package name is the name of the source. Thus if you wrote TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::Ruby, the name of your source would be "Ruby".
Load the necessary modules and register your source handler. For a Ruby source handler, it might look like this:


package TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::Ruby;
use strict;
use warnings;

use TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory   ();
use TAP::Parser::Iterator::Process ();
TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory->register_handler(__PACKAGE__);

Implement the can_handle() method. The task of this method is to return a score between 0 and 1 for how likely it is that your source handler can handle a given source. A bunch of information is passed in a hash to the method, so you can check it all out. For example, if you wanted to run Ruby tests ending in .rb, you might write something like this:


sub can_handle {
  my ( $class, $source ) = @_;
  my $meta = $source->meta;

  # If it's not a file (test script), we're not interested.
  return 0 unless $meta->{is_file};

  # Get the file suffix, if any.
  my $suf = $meta->{file}{lc_ext};

  # If the config specifies a suffix, it's required.
  if ( my $config = $source->config_for('Ruby') ) {
      if ( defined $config->{suffix} ) {
          # Return 1 for a perfect score.
          return $suf eq $config->{suffix} ? 1 : 0;
      }
  }

  # Otherwise, return a score for our supported suffix.
  return $suf eq '.rb' ? 0.8 : 0;
}


The last line is the most important: it returns 0.8 if the suffix is .rb, saying that it's likely that this handler can handle the test. But the middle bit is interesting, too. The $source->config_for('Ruby') call is seeing if the user specified a suffix, either via the command-line or in the options. So in a Build.PL, that might be:


  tap_harness_args => {
      sources => {
          Perl => undef,
          Ruby => { suffix => '.rub' },
      }
  },


Meaning that the user wanted to run tests ending in .rub as Ruby tests. It can also be done on the command-line with prove:


prove --source Ruby --ruby-option suffix=.rub


Cool, eh? We have a reasonable default for Ruby tests, .rb, but the user can override however she likes.
And finally, implement the make_iterator() method. The job of this method is simply to create a TAP::Parser::Iterator object to actually run the test. It might look something like this:


sub make_iterator {
  my ( $class, $source ) = @_;
  my $config = $source->config_for('Ruby');

  my $fn = ref $source->raw ? ${ $source->raw } : $source->raw;
  $class->_croak(
      'No such file or directory: ' . defined $fn ? $fn : ''
  ) unless $fn && -e $fn;

  return TAP::Parser::Iterator::Process->new({
      command => [$config->{ruby} || 'ruby', $fn ],
      merge   => $source->merge
  });
}


Simple, right? Just make sure we have a valid file to execute, then instantiate and return a TAP::Parser::Iterator::Process object to actually run the test.


That's it. Just two methods and you're ready to go. I've even added support for a suffix option and a ruby option (so that you can point to the ruby executable in case it's not in your path). Using it is easy. I wrote a quick TAP-emitting Ruby script like so:


puts 'ok 1 - This is a test'
puts 'ok 2 - This is another test'
puts 'not ok 3 - This is a failed test'


And to run this test (assuming that TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::Ruby has been installed somewhere where Perl can find it), it's just:


% prove --source Ruby ~/try.rb --verbose
/Users/david/try.rb .. 
ok 1 - This is a test
ok 2 - This is another test
not ok 3 - This is a failed test
Failed 1/3 subtests 

Test Summary Report
-------------------
/Users/david/try.rb (Wstat: 0 Tests: 3 Failed: 1)
  Failed test:  3
  Parse errors: No plan found in TAP output
Files=1, Tests=3,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr +  0.01 sys =  0.03 CPU)
Result: FAIL


It's so easy to create new source handlers now, especially if all you have to do is support a new dynamic language. I've put the simple Ruby example over here; feel free to take it and run with it!

titleMake the Pragmas Stop!
body°TI've been following the development of a few things in the Perl community lately, and it‚Äôs leaving me very frustrated. For years now, I've written modules that start with the same incantation:

package My::Module;

use strict;
our $VERSION = '0.01';


Pretty simple: declare the module name and version, and turn on strictures to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid. More recently I've added use warnings; as a best practice. And even more recently, I've started adding use utf8;, too, because I like to write my code in UTF-8. And I like to turn on all of the Perl 5.10 features. It‚Äôs mildly annoying to have the same incantation at the start of every module, but I could deal with it:

package My::Module;

use strict;
use warnings;
use feature ':5.10';
use utf8;

our $VERSION = '0.01';


Until now that is. Last year, chromatic started something with his Modern::Perl module. It was a decent idea for newbies to help them get started with Perl by having to have only one declaration at the tops of their modules:

package My::Module;

use Modern::Perl;
our $VERSION = '0.01';


Alas, it wasn‚Äôt really designed for me, but for more casual users of Perl, so that they don‚Äôt have to think about the pragmas they need to use. The fact that it doesn‚Äôt include the utf8 pragma also made it a non-starter for me. Or did it? Someone recently suggested that the utf8 pragma has problems (I can‚Äôt find the Perl Monks thread at the moment). Others report that the encoding pragma has issues, too. So what‚Äôs the right thing to do with regard to assuming everything is UTF8 in my program and its inputs (unless I say otherwise)? I'm not at all sure.

Not only that, but Modern::Perl has lead to an explosion of other pragma-like modules on CPAN that promise best pragma practices. There‚Äôs common::sense, which loads utf8 but only some of of the features of strict, warnings, and feature. uni::perl looks almost exactly the same. There‚Äôs also Damian Conway‚Äôs Toolkit, which allows you to write your own pragma-like loader module. There‚Äôs even Acme::Very::Modern::Perl, which is meant to be a joke, but is it really?

If I want to simplify the incantation at the top of every file, what do I use?

And now it‚Äôs getting worse. In addition to feature, Perl 5.11 introduces the legacy pragma, which allows one to get back behaviors from older Perls. For example, to get back the old Unicode semantics, you'd use legacy 'unicode8bit';. I mean, WTF?

I've had it. Please make the pragma explosion stop! Make it so that the best practices known at the time of the release of any given version of Perl can automatically imported if I just write:

package My::Module '0.01';
use 5.12;


That‚Äôs it. Nothing more.  Whatever has been deemed the best practice at the time 5.12 is released will simply be used. If the best practices change in 5.14, I can switch to use 5.14; and get them, or just leave it at use 5.12 and keep what was the best practices in 5.12 (yay future-proofing!).

What should the best practices be? My list would include:


strict
warnings
features ‚Äî all of them
UTF-8 ‚Äî all input and output to the scope, as well as the source code



Maybe you disagree with that list. Maybe I'd disagree with what Perl 5 Porters settles on. But then you can I can read what‚Äôs included and just add or removed pragmas as necessary. But surely there‚Äôs a core list of likely candidates that should be included the vast majority of the time, including for all novices.

In personal communication, chromatic tells me, with regard to Modern::Perl, ‚ÄúExperienced Perl programmers know the right incantations to get the behavior they want. Novices don‚Äôt, and I think we can provide them much better defaults without several lines of incantations.‚Äù I'm fine with the second assertion, but disagree with the first. I've been hacking Perl for almost 15 years, and I no longer have any fucking idea what incantation is best to use in my modules. Do help the novices, and make the power tools available to experienced hackers, but please make life easier for the experienced hackers, too.

I think that declaring the semantics of a particular version of Perl is where the Perl 5 Porters are headed. I just hope that includes handling all of the likely pragmas too, so that I don‚Äôt have to.

bodyáI‚Äôve just released
DBIx::Connector 0.42 to CPAN. This release fixes a serious bug with catch blocks.
In short, if you threw an exception from inside a catch block, it would not be
detectable from outside. For example, given this code:

eval {
    $conn->run(sub { die 'WTF' }, catch => sub { die 'OMG!' });
};
if (my $err = $@) {
    say "We got an error: $@\n";
}


With DBIx::Connector 0.41 and lower, the if block would never be called,
because even though the catch block threw an exception, $@ was not set. In
other words, the exception would not be propagated to its caller. This could
be terribly annoying, as you can imagine. I was being a bit too clever about
localizing $@, with the scope much too broad. 0.42 uses a much tighter scope
to localize $@, so now it should propagate properly everywhere.

So if you‚Äôre using DBIx::Connector catch blocks, please upgrade ASAP. Sorry
for the hassle.

titleGenerating XML in Perl
body≤&I've been working on a big Bricolage
project recently, and one of the requirements is to parse an incoming NewsML
feed, turn individual stories into Bricolage SOAP XML, and import them into
Bricolage. I'm using the amazing--if hideously
documented--XML::LibXML to do the parsing of the incoming
NewsML, taking advantage of the power of XPath to pull out the bits I need.
But then came the question: what should I use to generate the XML for
Bricolage?

Based on feedback from various Tweeps, I tried a few different approaches:
XML::LibXML,
XML::Genx, and of course the
venerable XML::Writer. In truth, they all suck for one
reason: interface. As a test, I wanted to generate this dead simple
XML:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<assets xmlns="http://bricolage.sourceforge.net/assets.xsd">
  <story id="1234" type="story">
    <name>Catch as Catch Can</name>
  </story>
</assets>


Just get a load of how you create this XML in XML::LibXML:


use XML::LibXML;

my $dom = XML::LibXML::Document->new( '1.0', 'utf-8' );
my $assets = $dom->createElementNS('http://bricolage.sourceforge.net/assets.xsd', 'assets');
$dom->addChild($assets);

my $story = $dom->createElement('story');
$assets->addChild($story);
$story->addChild( $dom->createAttribute( id => 1234));
$story->addChild( $dom->createAttribute( type => 'story'));
my $name = $dom->createElement('name');
$story->addChild($name);
$name->addChild($dom->createTextNode('Catch as Catch Can'));

say $dom->toString;


Does anyone actually think that this is intuitive? Okay, if you're used to
dealing with the XHTML DOM in JavaScript it's at least familiar, but
that's hardly an endorsement. XML::Genx isn't much better:


use XML::Genx::Simple;

my $w = XML::Genx::Simple->new;
$w->StartDocString;

$w->StartElementLiteral( $w->DeclareNamespace( 'http://bricolage.sourceforge.net/assets.xsd', ''), 'assets' );
$w->StartElementLiteral( 'story' );
$w->AddAttributeLiteral( id => 1234);
$w->AddAttributeLiteral( type => 'story');
$w->Element( 'name' => 'Catch as Catch Can' );
$w->EndElement;
$w->EndElement;
$w->EndDocument;

say $w->GetDocString;


It's not like messing with the DOM, but it's essentially the same: Use a
bunch of camelCase methods to declare each thing one-at-a-time. And you have
to count the number of open elements you have yourself, to know how many times
to call EndElement() to close elements. Can't we get the computer
to do this for us?

Feeling a bit frustrated, I went back to XML::Writer, which is what
Bricolage uses internally to generate the XML exported by its SOAP interface.
It looks like this:


use XML::Writer;

my $output = '';
my $writer = XML::Writer->new(
    OUTPUT=> \$output,
    ENCODING => 'utf8',
);

$writer->xmlDecl('UTF-8');
#$writer->startTag(['http://bricolage.sourceforge.net/assets.xsd', 'stories']);
$writer->startTag('assets', xmlns => 'http://bricolage.sourceforge.net/assets.xsd');
$writer->startTag('story', id => 1234, type => 'story');
$writer->dataElement(name => 'Catch as Catch Can');
$writer->endTag('story');

$writer->endTag('assets');

say $output;


That's a bit better, in that you can specify the attributes and value of an
element all in one method call. I still have to count opened elements and
figure out where to close them, though. The thing that's missing, as with the
other approaches, is an API that reflects the hierarchical nature of XML
itself. I'm outputting a tree-like document; why should the API be so
hideously object-oriented and flat?

With this insight, I remembered Jesse
Vincent's Template::Declare. It bills itself as a
templating library, but really it provides an interface for declaratively and
hierarchically generating XML. After a bit of hacking I came up with this:


package Template::Declare::TagSet::Bricolage;
BEGIN { $INC{'Template/Declare/TagSet/Bricolage.pm'} = __FILE__; }
use base 'Template::Declare::TagSet';

sub get_tag_list {
    return [qw( assets story name )];
}

package My::Template;
use Template::Declare::Tags 'Bricolage';
use base 'Template::Declare';

template bricolage => sub {
    xml_decl { 'xml', version => '1.0', encoding => 'utf-8' };
    assets {
        xmlns is 'http://bricolage.sourceforge.net/assets.xsd';
        story {
            attr { id => 1234, type => 'story' };
            name { 'Catch as Catch Can' }
        };
    };
};

package main;
use Template::Declare;
Template::Declare->init( roots => ['My::Template']);
say Template::Declare->show('bricolage');


Okay, to be fair I had to do a lot more work to set things up. But once I
did, the core of the XML generation, there in the bricolage
template, is quite simple and straight-forward. Furthermore, thanks to the
hierarchical nature of Template::Declare, the tree structure of the resulting
XML is apparent in the code. And it's so concise!

Armed with this information, I whipped up a new module for CPAN:
Template::Declare::Bricolage.
This module subclasses Template::Declare to provide a dead-simple interface
for generating XML for the Bricolage SOAP interface. Using this module to
generate the same XML is quite simple:


use Template::Declare::Bricolage;

say bricolage {
    story {
        attr { id => 1234, type => 'story' };
        name { 'Catch as Catch Can' }
    };
};


Yeah. Really. That's it. Because the Bricolage SOAP interface
requires that all XML documents have the top-level <assets>
tag, I just had the bricolage function handle that, as well as
actually executing the template and returning the XML. More complex XML is
just a simple, assuming that you use nice indentation to format your code.
Here's the code to generate XML for a Bricolage workflow object:


use Template::Declare::Bricolage;

say bricolage {
    workflow {
        attr        { id => 1027     };
        name        { 'Blogs'        }
        description { 'Blog Entries' }
        site        { 'Main Site'    }
        type        { 'Story'        }
        active      { 1              }
        desks  {
            desk { attr { start   => 1 }; 'Blog Edit'    }
            desk { attr { publish => 1 }; 'Blog Publish' }
        }
    }
};


Simple, huh? So the next time you need to generate XML, have a look at
Template::Declare. It may not be the
fastest XML generator around, but if you have a well-defined list of
elements you need, it's certainly the nicest to use.

Oh, and Bricolage users? Just make use of
use Template::Declare::Bricolage
to deaden the pain.

The issue I had came down to an inability to parse both standalone emphasis

doubled-up emphasis characters, such as ***, ___, **_, or _**, among a
few others. It seemed that I could handle one or the other issue, but not
both.

The insight was that I could add more tokens to match doubled emphasis
characters before single emphasis characters. Then I could just process them
separately. So whereas I previously had

    [ EMLOP => qr/(?<=[^\s_])[_]{1,2}|(?<=[^\s*])[*]{1,2}/ ],
    [ EMROP => qr/[_]{1,2}(?=[^\s_])|[*]{1,2}(?=[^\s*])/ ],


I now have a regular expression to match doubled-up emphasis operators:

my $stem_re = qr{
      (?:[*]{2}|[_]{2})[*_]
    | [*_](?:[*]{2}|[_]{2})
}x;


And I use it like so:

    [ STEMLOP => qr/$stem_re(?=[^\s_*])/ ],
    [ STEMROP => qr/(?<=[^\s_*])$stem_re/ ],

    [ EMLOP => qr/[_]{1,2}(?=[^\s*_])|[*]{1,2}(?=[^\s*_])/ ],
    [ EMROP => qr/(?<=[^\s*_])[_]{1,2}|(?<=[^\s*_])[*]{1,2}/ ],


Yes, I‚Äôm now also matching ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù emphasis operators ‚Äî that is, those with
non-whitespace on both sides. But now I‚Äôm able to get pretty much exactly
what I need with a rule like this:

my $lstar = match EMLOP => '*';
my $rstar = match EMROP => '*';
my $lline = match EMLOP => '_';
my $rline = match EMROP => '_';
my $not_em;
my $Not_em = parser { $not_em->(@_) };

my $emphasis = T(
    alternate(
        concatenate( $lstar,  $Not_em, $rstar  ),
        concatenate( $lline,  $Not_em, $rline  ),
    ),
    sub { "<em>$_[1]</em>" }
);


Pretty much the same as before. But now I also have this rule, to deal with
the combined strong and emphasis tokens:

my $lstem = match 'STEMLOP';
my $rstem = match 'STEMROP';
my $mstem = match 'STEMMOP';
my $not_stem;
my $Not_stem = parser { $not_stem->(@_) };

my $stem = T(
    concatenate(
        alternate($lstem, $mstem),
        $Not_stem,
        alternate($rstem, $mstem)
    ),
    sub {
        my @c = split //, shift;
        return $c[0] eq $c[1]
            ? "<strong><em>$_[1]</em></strong>"
            : "<em><strong>$_[1]</strong></em>";
    },
);


In truth, I ended up with something much more complicated than this, as it
needed to make sure that the operators were balanced (e.g., you can‚Äôt do it
***like this___), but the overall idea is the same. The emphasis, strong,
and strong/em parsers also handle mid-word markers, such as in
un*frigging*believable, that I‚Äôm not showing here. But the overall approach
is fundamentally the same: I was having a problem with two patterns getting in
the way of my parser, so I simply wrote a separate parser to handle one of
those patterns. Ultimately, all I had to do was break the problem down into
smaller parts and solve each part individually. It works pretty well.

As a side note, at one point I had the a lexer that used this code ref:

my $stem_split = sub {
    my $l = shift;
    my @c = split //, shift;
    my $pos = substr($l, 4);
    return $c[0] eq $c[1]
        ? ( [ $l => "$c[0]$c[1]"], [ $l => $c[2]]         )
        : ( [ $l => $c[0] ],       [ $l => "$c[1]$c[2]" ] );
};


Those STEMOP rules then looked like so:

    [ EMMOP => qr/(?<=[^\s_*])$stem_re(?=[^\s_*])/, $stem_split ],
    [ EMROP => qr/(?<=[^\s_*])$stem_re/, $stem_split ],


The cool thing about this was that I didn‚Äôt need a separate strong/emphasis
parser; these lexer rules were just returning the appropriate emphasis tokens,
and then I was able to just let the emphasis and strong parsers do their
things.

But I ran into issues when I realized that it the left and right versions were
coming out the same, so for ***foo***, rather than getting
<strong><em>foo</em></strong>, I was getting <strong><em>foo</strong></em>.
Oops. I could solve this by using different splitters for left and right, but
once I added the middle token, wherein there are no whitespace characters on
either side, it‚Äôs impossible to tell which token to return first. So I went
back to the separate strong/emphasis operators.

Another path I started down was separate tokens for strong and emphasis
markers. It looked something like this:

    [ STLOP => qr/[_]{2}(?=[_]?\S)|[*]{2}(?=[*]?\S)/ ],
    [ STROP => qr/(?<=\S)[_]{2}|(?<=\S)[*]{2}/ ],
    [ EMLOP => qr/[_*](?=\S)/ ],
    [ EMROP => qr/(?<=\S)[_*]/ ],


With this approach, I thought I could match the strong and emphasis operators
separately in the lexer. But as I described on the HOP-discuss mail list,
this runs up to limitations of the lexer. For example, for these rules, the
string _*foo*__ yields the proper tokens:

[['STLOP','_'],['EMLOP','*'],'foo,['EMROP','*'],['STROP','_']];


But *__foo__* does not:

['*',['STLOP','_'],'foo,['STLOP','_'],'*'];


The problem is that the lexer splits the string up into tokens and leftovers
after each rule is parsed. So after STLOP and STROP are parsed, the stream
looks like this:

 ['*',['STLOP','_'],'foo,['STLOP','_'],'*'];


In other words, exactly the same. When EMLOP and EMROP are applied to ‚Äò*‚Äô,
there is no non-space character before or after it, so it‚Äôs left alone. But
clearly this is an invalid lexing.

So I had to once again go back to the more complicated solution of a separate
parser for combined span operators. For now. I‚Äôm hoping someone can come up
with a solution to make this lex better, because I‚Äôm going to be adding more
span operators, such as for code, deleted text, and added text, and it will
very quickly get complicated parsing for those combinations of characters.
It‚Äôd be much better if the lexer could see something like

+**_`test *markdown*`_**+


And correctly give me:

[
    [ ADDLOP => '+'                 ],
    [ STLOP  => '**'                ],
    [ EMLOP  => '_'                 ],
    [ CODE   => '`test *markdown*`' ],
    [ EMROP  => '_'                 ],
    [ STROP  => '**'                ],
    [ ADDROP => '+'                 ],
]


And then the parsing would be quite straight-forward. Because otherwise my
parser is just going to get more complex and harder to maintain.

title*How to Use Regex Named Captures in Perl 5
bodyõSI ran some Perl 5 regular expression syntax that I'd never seen the other
day. It used two features I'd never seen before:


  (?{ }), a zero-width, non-capturing assertion that executes
    arbitrary Perl code.
  $^N, a variable for getting the contents of the most recent
    capture in a regular expresion.


The cool thing is that, used in combination, these two features can be used
to hack named captures into Perl regular expressions. Here's an example:


use warnings;
use strict;
use Data::Dumper;

my $string = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog';

my %found;

my @captures = $string =~ /
    (?: (quick|slow) \s+    (?{ $found{speed}  = $^N  }) )
    (?: (brown|blue) \s+    (?{ $found{color}  = $^N  }) )
    (?: (sloth|fox)  \s+    (?{ $found{animal} = $^N  }) )
    (?: (eats|jumps)        (?{ $found{action} = $^N  }) )
/xms;

print Dumper \@captures;
print Dumper \%found;


The output of running this program is:


$VAR1 = [
          'quick',
          'brown',
          'fox',
          'jumps'
        ];
$VAR1 = {
          'color' => 'brown',
          'speed' => 'quick',
          'action' => 'jumps',
          'animal' => 'fox'
        };


So the positional captures are still returned, and we've assigned
them to keys in a hash. This can be very convenient for complex regular
expressions.

This is a cool feature, but there are a few caveats. First, according to
the Perl regular expression
documentation, (?{ }) is a highly
experimental feature that could go away at any time. But more importantly, if
you're relying on this feature you should be aware of the side effects. What I
mean by that is that, if a regular expression match fails, but there are some
successful matches during execution, then the code in the (?{ })
assertions could still execute. For example, if you changed the
word jumps to poops in the above example, the output becomes:


$VAR1 = [];
$VAR1 = {
          'color' => 'brown',
          'speed' => 'quick',
          'animal' => 'fox'
        };


Which means that the match failed, but there were still assignments to our
hash, because some of the captures succeeded before the overall match failed.
The upshot is that you should always check the return value from the match
before relying on whatever the code inside the (?{ }) assertions
did.

The problem becomes even more subtle if your regular expressions trigger
backgracking. In that case, you might have an optional group match and its
value assigned to the hash, and then the next required group fail. Perl will
then backtrack to throw out the successfull group match and then see if the
next required match succeeds. If so, you can have a successful match and
potentially invalid data in your hash. Here's an example:


my @captures = $string =~ /
    (?: (quick|slow) \s+    (?{ $found{speed}  = $^N  }) )
    (?: (brown|blue) \s+    (?{ $found{color}  = $^N  }) )?
    (?: (brown\s+fox)       (?{ $found{animal} = $^N  }) )
/xms;

print Dumper \@captures;
print Dumper \%found;


And the output is:


$VAR1 = [
          'quick',
          undef,
          'brown fox'
        ];
$VAR1 = {
          'color' => 'brown',
          'speed' => 'quick',
          'animal' => 'brown fox'
        };


So while the second group returned undef for the color
capture, the %foundhash still had the color key in it. This may
or may not be what you want.

Of course, all this seems cool, but since it's a truly evil hack, you have
to be careful. If you can wait, though, perhaps we'll
see named captures in Perl 5.10.

titleThe Future of SVN::Notify
bodyßlThis week, I imported pgTAP
into GitHub. It took me a day or so to wrap my brain around
how it's all supposed to work, with generous
help from
Tekkub. But I'm starting to get the hang of it, and I like it. By the end
of the day, I had sent push requests
to Test::More
and Blosxom Plugins. I'm well on my
way to being hooked.

One of the things I want, however,
is SVN::Notify-type commit emails. I know that there are feeds, but
they don't have diffs, and for however much I like using NetNewsWire to feed
by political news addiction, it never worked for me for commit activity. And
besides, why download the whole damn thing again, diffs and all (assuming that
ever happens), for every refresh. Seems like a hell of a lot unnecessary
network activity‚Äînot to mention actual CPU cycles.

So I would need a decent notification application. I happen to have one. I
originally wrote SVN::Notify after I had already
written activitymail, which sends noticies for CVS commits. SVN::Notify has
changed a lot over the years, and now it's looking a bit daunting to consider
porting it to Git.

However, just to start thinking about it, SVN::Notify really does several
different things:


  Fetches relevant information about a Subversion event.
  Parses that information for a number of different outputs.
  Writes the event information into one or more outputs (currently plain text or XHTML).
  Constructs an email message from the outputs
  Sends the email message via a specified method (sendmail or SMTP).


For the initial implementation of SVN::Notify, this made a lot of sense,
because it was doing something fairly simple. It was designed to be extensible
by subclassing (successfully done
by SVN::Notify::Config
and
SVN::Notify::Mirror),
and, later,
by output
filters, and that was about it.

But as I think about moving stuff to Git, and consider the weaknesses of
extensibility by subclassing (it's just not pretty), I'm naturally rethinking
this architecture. I wouldn't want to have to do it all over again should some
future SCM system come along in the future. So, following from a private
exchange with
Martijn Van Beers, I have some
preliminary thoughts on how a hypothetical SCM::Notify (VCS::Notify?) module
might be constructed:


  A single interface for fetching SCM activity information. There could be
  any number of implementations, just as long as they all provided the same
  interface. There would be a class for fetching information from Subversion,
  one for Git, one for CVS, etc.
  A single interface for writing a report for a given transaction. Again,
  there could be any number of implementations, but all would have the same
  interface: taking an SCM module and writing output to a file handle.
  A single interface for doing something with one or more outputs. Again,
  they can do things as varied as simply writing files to disk, appending to a
  feed, inserting into a database, or, of course, sending an email.
  The core module would process command-line arguments to determine what
  SCM is being used any necessary contextual information and just pass it on
  to the appropriate classes.


In psedudo-code, what I'm thinking is something like this:


package SCM::Notify;

sub run {
    my $args = shift->getopt;
    my $scm  = SCM::Interface->new(
        scm      => $args->{scm} # e.g., "SVN" or "Git", etc.
        revision => $args->{revision},
        context  => $args->{context} # Might include repository path for SVN.
    );

    my $report = SCM::Report->new(
        method => $opts->{method}, # e.g., SMTP, sendmail, Atom, etc.
        scm    => $scm,
        format => $args->{output}, # text, html, both, etc.
        params => $args->{params}, # to, from, subject, etc.
    );

    $report->send;
}


Then a report class just has to create report in the specified format or
formats and do something with them. For example, a Sendmail report would put
together a report as a multipart message with each format in a single part,
and then deliver it via /sbin/sendmail, something like this:


package SCM::Report::Sendmail;

sub send {
    my $self = shift;
    my $fh = $self->fh;
    for my $format ( $self->formats ) {
        print $fh SCM::Format->new(
            format => $format,
            scm    => $self->scm,
        );
    }

    $self->deliver;
}


So those are my rather preliminary thoughts. I think it'd actually be
pretty easy to port the logic of this stuff over from SVN::Notify; what needs
some more thought is what the command-line interface might look like and how
options are passed to the various classes, since the Sendmail report class
will require different parameters than the SMTP report class or the Atom
report class. But once that's worked out in a way that can be handled
neutrally, we'll have a much more extensible implementation that will be easy
to add on to going forward.

Any suggestions for passing different parameters to different classes in a
single interface? Everything needs to be able to be handled via command-line
options and not be ugly or difficult to use.

So, you wanna work on this? :-)

titlePod::Simple 3.09 Hits the CPAN
body®I spent some time over the last few days helping Allison fix bugs and close
tickets for a new version of
Pod::Simple. I'm not sure how I convinced Allison to suddenly
dedicate her day to fixing Pod::Simple bugs and putting out a new release. She
must've had some studies or Parrot spec work she wanted to get out of or
something.

Either way, it's got some useful fixes and improvements:


  The XHTML formatter now supports tables of contents (via the
  poorly-named-but-consistent-with-the-HTML-formatter index
  parameter).

  
    You can now reformat verbatim blocks via the
    strip_verbatim_indent parameter/method. Because you have to
    indent verbatim blocks (code examples) with one or more spaces, you end up
    with those spaces remaining in output. Just have a look at
    an example on search.cpan.org. See how the
    code in the Synopsis is indented? That's because it's indented in the POD.
    But maybe you don't want it to be indented in your final output. If not, you can 
    strip out leading spaces via strip_verbatim_indent. Pass in
    the text to strip out:

    $parser->strip_verbatim_indent('  ');

    Or a code reference that figures out what to strip out. I'm fond of
    stripping based on the indentation of the first line, like so:

    
$new->strip_verbatim_indent(sub {
      my $lines = shift;
      (my $indent = $lines->[0]) =~ s/\S.*//;
      return $indent;
  });

  

  You can now use the nocase parameter to
      Pod::Simple::PullParser to tell the parser to ignore the case of POD
      blocks when searching for author, title, version, and description
      information. This is a hack that Graham has used for a while on
      search.cpan.org, in part because I nagged him about my modules, which
      don't use uppercase =head1 text. Thanks Graham!

  Fixed entity encoding in the XHTML formatter. It was failing to
      encode entities everywhere except code spans and verbatim blocks. Oops.
      It also now properly encodes E<sol> and
      E<verbar>, as well as numeric entities.

  Multiparagraph items now work properly in the XHTML formatter, as do
      text items (definition lists).

  A POD tag found inside a complex POD tag (e.g., C<<<
	C<foo> >>>) is now properly parsed as text and
	entities instead of a tag embedded in a tag (e.g.,
        <foo>). This is in compliance
        with perlpod.


This last item is the only change I think might lead to problems. I fixed
it in response to
a bug report from Schwern. The relevant bit from
the perlpod spec is:


    A more readable, and perhaps more ‚Äúplain‚Äù way is to use an alternate
       set of delimiters that doesn‚Äôt require a single ‚Äú>‚Äù to be escaped.
       With the Pod formatters that are standard starting with perl5.5.660,
       doubled angle brackets (‚Äú<<‚Äù and ‚Äú>>‚Äù) may be used if and
       only if there is whitespace right after the opening delimiter and
       whitespace right before the closing delimiter! For example, the
       following will do the trick:

    C<< $a <=> $b >>

    In fact, you can use as many repeated angle‚Äêbrackets as you like so
       long as you have the same number of them in the opening and closing
       delimiters, and make sure that whitespace immediately follows the last
       ‚Äô<‚Äô of the opening delimiter, and immediately precedes the first
       ‚Äú>‚Äù of the closing delimiter. (The whitespace is ignored.) So the
       following will also work:

    C<<< $a <=> $b >>>
C<<<<  $a <=> $b     >>>>

    And they all mean exactly the same as this:

    C<$a E<lt>=E<gt> $b>


Although all of the examples use C<< >>, it seems
pretty clear that it applies to all of the span tags (
B<< >>, I<< >>,
F<< >>, etc.). So I made the change so that tags
embedded in these ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù tags, as comments in Pod::Simple call them, are
not treated as tags. That is, all < and >
characters are encoded.

Unfortunately, despite what the perlpod spec says (at least in my reading),
Sean had quite a few pathological examples in the tests that expected POD tags
embedded in complex POD tags to work. Here's an example:

L<<< Perl B<Error E<77>essages>|perldiag >>>

Before I fixed the bug, that was expected to be output as this XML:

<L to="perldiag" type="pod">Perl <B>Error Messages</B></L>

After the bug fix, it's:

<L content-implicit="yes" section="Perl B&#60;&#60;&#60; Error E&#60;77&#62;essages" type="pod">&#34;Perl B&#60;&#60;&#60; Error E&#60;77&#62;essages&#34;</L>

Well, there's a lot more crap that Pod::Simple puts in there, but the
important thing to note is that neither the B<> nor
the E<> is evaluated as a POD tag inside
the L<<< >>> tag. If that seems inconsistent at
all, just remember that POD tags still work inside non-complex POD tags (that
is, when there is just one set of angle brackets:

L<Perl B<Error E<77>essages>|perldiag>

I'm pretty sure that few users were relying on POD tags working inside
complex POD tags anyway. At least I hope so. I'm currently working up a patch
for blead that updates Pod::Simple in core, so it will be interesting to see
if it breaks anyone's POD. Here's to hoping it doesn't!

title+SVN::Notify 2.30 Adds Issue Tracking Links
bodyîI released a new version of SVN::Notify last night, 2.30. This new version has a few things going for it.

First, and most obviously from the point of view of users of the HTML subclass, I've added new options for specifying Request Tracker, Bugzilla, and JIRA URLs. The --rt-url, --bugzilla-url, and --jira-url options have an effect much like the parallel feature in CVSspam: pass in a string with the spot for the ID represented by %s, such as http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?id=%s for RT or http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=%s for Bugzilla. SVN::Notify::HTML will then look for the appropriate strings (such as Ticket # 1234 for RT or Bug # 4321 for Bugzilla) and turn them into URLs.

This functionality has been extended to the old --viewcvs-url option, to. For the sake of consistency, it now also requires a URL of the same form (although if SVN::Notify doesn't see %s in the string, it will append a default and emit a warning), and will be used to create links for strings like Revision 654 in the log message.

SVN::Notify::HTML has an additional new option, --linkize, that will force any email addresses or URLs it finds in the log message to be turned into links. Again, this works like it does for CVSspam; I'm grateful to Jeffrey Friedl's Mastering Regular Expressions, Second Edition for the excellent regular expressions for matching URLs and email addresses.

All of this was made possible by moving the processing of options from svnnotify to SVN::Notify->get_options and adding a new class method, SVN::Notify->register_attributes. This second method allows Bricolage subclasses to easily add new attributes; register_attributes() will create accessor methods and add command-line option processing for each new attribute required by a subclass. Then, when you execute svnnotify --handler HTML, SVN::Notify->get_options processes the default options, loads the SVN::Notify::Handler subclass, and then processes any options specified by the subclass. The short story is that all of this is the detail-oriented way of saying that it is easier to subclass SVN::Notify and be able to automatically load the necessary options and attributes via the same executable, svnnotify.

This change was motivated not only by my desire to add the new features to SVN::Notify::HTML, but also by Autrijus' new modules, SVN::Notify::Snapshot and SVN::Notify::Config. Thanks Autrijus!

I'll try to get a nice example of all this functionality up in the next few days; if anyone else creates one first, send it to me! But in the meantime, enjoy!

titleDBIx::Connector Updated
body≠ZAfter much gnashing of teeth, heated arguments with @robkinon and @mst,
lots of deep thesaurus spelunking, and three or four iterations, I finally
came up with an an improved API
for DBIx::Connector that I believe is
straight-forward and easy to explain.

Following up on
my post last week, I
explored, oh I dunno, a hundred different terms for the various methods? I've
never spent so much time
on thesaurus.com in my life. Part of
what added to the difficulty was that @mst seemed to think that there should
actually be three modes for each block method: one that pings, one that
doesn't, and one that tries again if a block dies and the connection is down.
So I went from six to nine methods with that assertion.

What I finally came up with was to name the three basic methods run(),
txn_run(), and svp_run(), and these would neither
ping nor retry in the event of failure. Then I added variations on these
methods that would ping and that would try to fix failures. I called these
‚Äúping runs‚Äù and ‚Äúfixup runs,‚Äù respectively. It was the latter term, ‚Äúfixup,‚Äù
that had been so hard for me to nail down, as ‚Äúretry‚Äù seemed to say that the
method was a retry, while ‚Äúfixup‚Äù more accurately reflects that the method
would try to fix up the connection in the event of a failure.

Once I'd implemented this interface, I now had nine methods:


  run()
  txn_run()
  svp_run()
  ping_run()
  txn_ping_run()
  svp_ping_run()
  fixup_run()
  txn_fixup_run()
  svp_fixup_run()


This worked great. Then I went about documenting it. Jesus Christ what a
pain! I realized that all these similarly-named methods would require a lot of
explanation. I duly wrote up said explanation, and just wasn't happy with it.
It just felt to me like all the explanation made it too difficult to decide
what methods to use and when. Such confusion would make the module less likely
to be used -- and certainly less likely to be used efficiently.

So I went back to the API drawing board and, reflecting on @robkinyon's
browbeating about decorating methods and @mst's coming to that conclusion as
well, I finally came up with just three methods:


  run()
  txn()
  svp()


For any one of these, you can call it by passing a block, of course:


$conn->txn( sub { $_->do('SELECT some_function()') } );


In addition, you can now have any one of them run in one of three
modes: the default (no ping), ‚Äúping‚Äù, or ‚Äúfixup‚Äù:


$conn->txn( fixup => sub { $_->do('SELECT some_function()') } );


It's much easier to explain the three methods in terms of how the
block is transactionally encapsulated, as that's the only difference between
them. Once that's understood, it's pretty easy to explain how to change the
‚Äúconnection mode‚Äù of each by passing in a leading string. It even looks pretty
nice. I'm really happy with this

One thing that increased the difficulty in coming up with this API was that
@mst felt that by default the methods should neither ping nor try to fix up a
failure. I was resistant to this because it's not
how Apache::DBI or
connect_cached() work: they always ping.
It turns out that DBIx::Class doesn't cache connections
at all. I thought it had. Rather, it creates a connection and simply hangs
onto it as a scalar variable. It handles the connection for as long as it's in
scope, but includes no magic global caching. This reduces the action-at-a-distance
issues common with caching while maintaining proper fork- and
thread-safety.

At this point, I took a baseball bat to my desk.

Figuratively, anyway. I did at least unleash a mountain of curses upon @mst
and various family relations. Because it took me a few minutes to see it: It
turns out that DBIx::Class is right to do it this way. So I ripped out the
global caching from DBIx::Connector, and suddenly it made much more sense not
to ping by default -- just as you wouldn't ping if you created a DBI handle
yourself.

DBIx::Conector is no longer a caching layer over the DBI. It's now
a proxy for a connection. That's it. There is no magic, no implicit
behavior, so it's easier to use. And because it ensures fork- and
thread-safety, you can instantiate a connector and hold onto it for whenever
you need it, unlike using the DBI itself.

And one more thing: I also added a new method, with(). For
those who always want to use the same connection mode, you can use this method
to create a proxy object that has a different default mode. (Yes, a proxy for
a proxy for a database handle. Whatever!) Use it like this:


$conn->with('fixup')->run( sub { ... } );


And if you always want to use the same mode, hold onto the proxy instead of
the connection object:


my $proxy = DBIx::Connector->(@args)->with('fixup');

# later ...
$proxy->txn( sub { ... } ); # always in fixup mode


So while fixup mode is no longer the default,
as Tim
requested, but it can optionally be made the default, as DBIx::Class
requires. The with() method will also be the place to add other
global behavioral modifications, such as
DBIx::Class's auto_savepoint feature.

So for those of you who were interested in the first iteration of this
module, my apologies for changing things so dramatically in this release
(ripping out the global caching, deprecating methods, adding a new block
method API, etc.). But I think that, for all the pain I went through to come
up with the new API -- all the arguing on IRC, all the thesaurus spelunking --
that this is a really good API, easy to explain and understand, and easy to
use. And I don't expect to change it again. I might improve exceptions (use
objects instead of strings?) add block method exception handling (perhaps
adding a catch keyword?), but the basics are finally nailed down
and here to stay.

Thanks to @mst, @robkinyon, and @ribasushi, in particular, for bearing with
me and continuing to hammer on me when I was being dense.

bodyÉ0After getting prodded by Erik Hatcher, I went ahead and added another subclass to SVN::Notify. This one adds a pretty colorized diff to the message, instead of just the plain text one. See an example here. I've also added links from the lists of affected files into the diffs in the HTML and new HTML::ColorDiff layouts.

Enjoy!

titleUp for Adoption: SVN::Notify
bodyâI‚Äôve kept my various Perl modules in a Subversion server run by my Bricolage support company, Kineticode, for many years. However, I‚Äôm having to shut down the server I‚Äôve used for all my services, including Subversion, so I‚Äôve moved them all to GitHub. As such, I no longer use Subversion in my day-to-day work.

It no longer seems appropriate that I maintain SVN::Notify. This has probably been my most popular modules, and I know that it‚Äôs used a lot. It‚Äôs also relatively stable, with few bug reports or complaints. Nevertheless, there certainly could be some things that folks want to add, like TLS support, I18N, and inline CSS.

Therefore, SVN::Notify is formally up for adoption. If you‚Äôre a Subversion users, it‚Äôs a great tool. Just look at this sample output. If you‚Äôd like to take over maintenance, make it even better, please get in touch. Leave a comment on this post, or @theory me on Twitter, or send an email.

PS: Would love it if someone also could take over activitymail, the CVS notification script from which SVN::Notify was derived ‚Äî and which I have even less right to maintain, given that I haven‚Äôt used CVS in years.

title*SVN::Notify 2.56 Adds Alternative Formats
body≤I've just uploaded SVN::Notify 2.56 to CPAN. Check a mirror near you! There have been a lot of changes since I last posted about SVN::Notify (for the 2.50 release), not least of which is that SourceForge has standardized on it for their Subversion roll out. W00t! The result was a couple of patches from SourceForge's David Burley to add headers and footers and to truncate diffs over a certain size. See the sample output for how it looks. Thanks, David!

The change I'm most pleased with in 2.56 is the addition of SVN::Notify::Alternative, based on a submission from Jukka Zitting. This new subclass allows you to actually combine a number of other subclasses into a single activity notification message. Why? Well, mainly because, though you might like to get HTML messages with colorized diffs, some mail clients might not care for the HTML. They would much prefer the plain text version.

SVN::Notify::Alternative allows you to have your cake and eat it too: send a single message with multipart/alternative sections for both HTML output and plain text. Plain text will always be used; to use HTML::ColorDiff with it, just do this:


svnnotify --repos-path "$1" --revision "$2" \
  --to developers@example.com --handler Alternative \
  --alternative HTML::ColorDiff --with-diff


This incantation will send an email with both the plain text and HTML::ColorDiff formats. If you look at it in Mail.app, you'll see the nice colorized format, and if you look at it in pine, you'll see the plain text.

For the curious, here are all of the changes since 2.50:


  2.56  2006-04-04T23:16:37
  
    
      Abstracted creation of the diff file handle into the new diff_handle()
        method.
      Documented use of diff_handle() in the output() method.
      Added optional second argument to output() to optionally suppress the
        output of the email headers. This argument is used by the new
        Alternative subclass.
      Added SVN::Notify::Alternative, which allows multiple versions of a
        commit email to be sent, such as text/plain plus HTML. The multiple
        versions are assembled into a single email message using the
        multipart/alternative media type. For those who want HTML messages but
        must support users that can only read plain text or rely on archives
        that ignore HTML messages, this can be very useful. Based on an
        implementation by Jukka Zitting.
      Fixed use_ok() tests that weren't running at all.
      Added an extra newline to separate the file list from an inline diff
        in the plain text format where --with-diff has been specified.
      Moved the multipart/mixed content-type header generation from
        output_headers() to output_content_type(), not only because this makes
        more sense, but also because it makes attachments behave better when
        using SVN::Notify::Alternative.
      Documented accessors in SVN::Notify::HTML.
    
  

  2.55  2006-04-03T23:11:11
  
    
      Added the io-layer option to specify an alternate IO layer. Will be
        most useful for those with repositories containing text in multiple
        encodings, where it should be set to raw.
      Fixed the context output in the subject for the --subject-cx option
        so that it's smarter about determining the longest common path.
        Reported by Max Horn.
      No longer modifying the values of the to_regex_map hash, so as not
        to mess with folks who might be passing it as a hash to more than one
        call to new(). Reported by Darby Felton.
      Added a meta http-equiv="content-type" tag to HTML output that
        includes the character set to help some clients in the proper display
        of the characters in an HTML email. I'm not sure if any clients
        actually need this help, but it certainly can't hurt!
      Added the --css-url option to specify an alternate style sheet for
        HTML emails. SVN::Notify::HTML's own CSS is left in the email, as
        well, so the specified style sheet can just override the default,
        rather than have to style everything itself. Yes, it takes advantage
        of the cascading feature of cascading style sheets! Based on a
        suggestion by Steve James.
    
  

  2.54  2006-03-06T00:33:42
  
    
      Added /usr/bin to the list of paths searched for executables.
        Suggested by Nacho Barrientos.
      Added --max-diff-length option. Patch from David Burley/SourceForge.
    
  

  2.53  2006-02-24T21:30:48
  
    
      Added header and footer attributes and command-line options to
        specify text to be put at the head and foot of each message. For HTML
        messages, the text will be escaped, unless it starts with <, in
        which case it will be assumed to be valid HTML and will therefore not
        be escaped. Either way, it will be output between <div> tags with the
        IDs header or footer as appropriate. Based on a patch from David
        Burley/SourceForge.
      Fixed the executable-searching algorithm added in 2.52 to add .exe
        to the name of the executable being searched for if $^O eq 'MSWin32'.
      Fixed encoding issues so that, under Perl 5.8 and later, the IO layer
        is set on file handles so as to encode input and decode output in the
        character set specified by the charset attribute. CPAN # 16050,
        reported by Michael Zehrer.
      Added a second argument to all calls to encode_entities() in
        SVN::Notify::HTML and SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff so that only '>'.
        '<', '&', and '"' are escaped.
      Fixed a bug in the _find_exe() function that was attempting to modify
        a constant variable. Patch from John Peacock.
      Turned the _find_exe() function into the find_exe() class method,
        since subclasses (such as SVN::Notify::Mirror) might want to use it.
    
  

  2.52  2006-02-19T18:50:24
  
    
      Now uses File::Spec->path to search for a validate sendmail or svnlook
        when they're not specified via their respective command-line options or
        environment variables. Suggested by Andreas Koenig. Not that they
        should probably be explicitly set anyway, as the $PATH environment
        variable tends to be non-existent when running under Apache.
    
  

  2.51  2006-01-02T23:28:11
  
    
      Fixed ColorDiff HTML to once again be valid XHTML 1.1.
    
  


Enjoy!

title$Use Rubyish Blocks with Test::XPath
bodyà8Thanks to the slick Devel::Declare-powered PerlX::MethodCallWithBlock
created by gugod, the latest
version of Test::XPath supports Ruby-style blocks. The
Ruby version of assert_select, as I
mentioned previously, looks like this:


assert_select "ol" { |elements|
  elements.each { |element|
    assert_select element, "li", 4
  }
}


I've switched to the brace syntax for greater parity with Perl.
Test::XPath, meanwhile, looks like this:


my @css = qw(foo.css bar.css);
$tx->ok( '/html/head/style', sub {
    my $css = shift @css;
    shift->is( './@src', $css, "Style src should be $css");
}, 'Should have style' );


But as of Test::XPath 0.13, you can now just use PerlX::MethodCallWithBlock
to pass blocks in the Rubyish way:


use PerlX::MethodCallWithBlock;
my @css = qw(foo.css bar.css);
$tx->ok( '/html/head/style', 'Should have style' ) {
    my $css = shift @css;
    shift->is( './@src', $css, "Style src should be $css");
};


Pretty slick, eh? It required a single-line change to the source code. I'm
really happy with this sugar. Thanks for
the great hack, gugod!

title"SVN::Notify 2.57 Supports Windows
bodyäxSo I finally got 'round to porting SVN::Notify to Windows. Version 2.57 is making is way to CPAN right now. The solution turned out to be dead simple: I just had to use a different form of piping open() on Windows, i.e., open FH, "$cmd|" instead of open FH, "-|"; exec($cmd);. It's silly, really, but it works. It really makes me wonder why -| and |- haven't been emulated on Windows. Whatever.

'Course the other thing I realized, after I made this change and all the tests pass, was that there is no equivalent of sendmail on Windows. So I added the --smtp option, so that now email can be sent to an SMTP server rather than to a local sendmail. I tested it out, and it seems to work, but I'd be especially interested to hear from folks using wide characters in their repositories: do they get printed properly to Net::SMTP's connection?

The whole list of changes in 2.57 (the output remains the same as in 2.56):


      Finally ported to Win32. It was actually a simple matter of changing
        how command pipes are created.
      Added --smtp option to enable sending messages to an SMTP server
        rather than to the local sendmail application. This is essential for
        Windows support.
      Added --io-layer to the usage statement in svnnotify.
      Fixed single-dash arguments in documentation so that they're all
        documented with a single dash in SVN::Notify.

title:SVN::Notify 2.70: Output Filtering and Character Encoding
body≥ I'm very pleased to announce the release of SVN::Notify 2.70. You can see an example of its colordiff output here. This is a major release that I've spent the last several weeks polishing and tweaking to get just right. There are quite a few changes, but the two most important are imporoved character encoding support and output filtering.

Improved Character Encoding Support

I've had a number of bug reports regarding issues with character encodings. Particularly for folks working in Europe and Asia, but really for anyone using multibyte characters in their source code and log messages (and we all do nowadays, don't we?), it has been difficult to find the proper incantation to get SVN::Notify to convert data from and to their proper encodings. Using a patch from Toshikazu Kinkoh as a starting-point, and with a lot of reading and experimentation, as well as regular and patient tests on Toshikazu's and Martin Lindhe's production systems, I think I've finally got it nailed down.

Now you can use the --encoding (formerly --charset), --svn-encoding, and --diff-encoding options‚Äîas well as --language‚Äîto get SVN::Notify to do the right thing. As long as your Subversion server's OS supports an appropriate locale, you should be golden (mine is old, with no UTF-8 locales :\). And if all else fails, you can still set the $LANG environment variable before executing svnnotify.

There is actually a fair bit to know about encodings to get it to work properly, but if you use UTF-8 throughout and your OS supports UTF-8 locales, you shouldn't have to do anything. You might have to set --language in order to get it to use the proper locale. See the new documentation of the encoding support for all the details. And if you still have problems, please do let me know.

Output Filtering

Much sexier is the addition of output filtering in SVN::Notify 2.70. I got pretty tired of getting feature requests for what are essentially formatting modifications, such as this one requesting support for KDE-style keyword support. I myself was using Trac wiki syntax in commit messages on a recent project and wanted to see them converted to HTML for messages output by SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff.

So I finally sat down and gave some though on how to implement a simple plugin architecture for SVN::Notify. When I realized that it was generally just formatting that people wanted, it became simpler: I just needed a way to allow folks to write simple output filters. The solution I came up with was to just use Perl. Output filters are simply subroutines named for the kind of output they filter. They live in perl packages. That's it.

For example, say that your developers write their commit log messages in Textile, and rather than receive them stuck inside <pre> tags, you'd like them converted to HTML. It's simple. Just put this code in a Perl module file:


package SVN::Notify::Filter::Textile;
use Text::Textile ();

sub log_message {
    my ($notifier, $lines) = @_;
    return $lines unless $notify->content_type eq 'text/html';
    return [ Text::Textile->new->process( join $/, @$lines ) ];
}


Put the file, SVN/Notify/Filter/Textile.pm somewhere in a Perl library directory. Then use the new --filter option to svnnotify to put it to work:


svnnotify -p "$1" -r "$2" --handler HTML::ColorDiff --filter Textile


Yep, that's it! SVN::Notify will find the filter module, load it, register its filtering subroutine, and then call it at the appropriate time. Of course, there are a lot of things you can filter; consult the  complete documentation for all of the details. But hopefully this gives you a flavor for how easy it is to write new filters for SVN::Notify. I'm hoping that all those folks who want featurs can now stop bugging me and writing their own filters to do the job, and uploading them to CPAN for all to share!

To get things started, I scratched my own itch, writing a Trac filter myself. The filter is almost as simple as the Textile example above, but I also spent quite a bit of time tweaking the CSS so that most of the Trac-generated HTML looks good. You can see an example right here. Thanks to a number of bug fixes in  Text::Trac, as well as Trac-specific CSS added via a filter on CSS output, it works beautifully. If I'm feeling motivated in the next week or so, I'll create a separate CPAN distribution with just a Markdown filter and upload it. That will create a nice distriution example for folks to copy to creat their own. Or maybe someone on the Lazy Web Will do it for me! Maybe you?

I wish I'd thought to do this from the beginning; it would have saved me from having to add so many features/cruft to SVN::Notify over the years. Here's a quick list of the features that likely could have been implemented via filters instead of added to the core:


  --user-domain: Combine the SVN username with a domain for the From header.
  --add-header: Add a header to the message.
  --reply-to: Add a specific header to the message.
  SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff: Frankly, looking back on it, I don't know why I didn't just put this support right into SVN::Notify::HTML. But even if I hadn't, it could have been implemented via filters.
  --subject-prefix:: Modify the message subject.
  --subject-cx: Add the commit context to the subject.
  --strip-cx-regex: More subject context modification.
  --no-first-line: Another subject filter.
  --max-sub-length: Yet another!
  --max-diff-length: A filter could truncate the diff, although this might be tricky with the HTML formatting.
  --author-url: Modify the metadata section to add a link to the author URL.
  --revision-url: Ditto for the revision URL.
  --ticket-map: Filter the log message for various ticketing system strings to convert to URLs. This also encompasses the old --rt-url, --bugzilla-url, --gnats-url, and --jira-url options.
  --header: Filter the beginning of the message.
  --footer: Filter the end of the message.
  --linkize: Filter the log message to convert URLs to links for HTML messages.
  --css-url: Filter the CSS to modify it, or filter the start of the HTML to add a link to an external CSS URL.
  --wrap-log: Reformat the log message for HTML.


Yes, really! That's about half the functionality right there. I'm glad that I won't have to add any more like that; filters are a much better way to go.

So download it, install it, write some filters, get your multibyte characters output properly, and enjoy! And as usual, send me your bug reports, but implement your own improvements using filters!

title)Suggest Method Names for DBIx::Connector
bodyògThanks to feedback from Tim Bunce and Peter Rabbitson in a DBIx::Class bug report, I've been reworking DBIx::Connector's block-handling methods. Tim's objection is that the the feature of do() and txn_do() that executes the code reference a second time in the event of a connection failure can be dangerous. That is, it can lead to action-at-a-distance bugs that are hard to find and fix. Tim suggested renaming the methods do_with_retry() and txn_do_with_retry() in order to make explicit what's going on, and to have non-retry versions of the methods.

I've made this change in the repository. But I wasn't happy with the method names; even though they're unambiguous, they are also overly long and not very friendly. I want people to use the retrying methods, but felt that the long names make the non-retrying preferable to users. While I was at it, I also wanted to get rid of do(), since it quickly became clear that it could cause some confusion with the DBI's do() method.

I've been thesaurus spelunking for the last few days, and have come up with a few options, but would love to hear other suggestions. I like using run instead of do to avoid confusion with the DBI, but otherwise I'm not really happy with what I've come up with. There are basically five different methods (using Tim's suggestions for the moment):


  run( sub {} )
  Just run a block of code.
  txn_run( sub {} )
  Run a block of code inside a transaction.
  run_with_retry( sub {} )
  Run a block of code without pinging the database, and re-run the code if it throws an exception and the database turned out to be disconnected.
  txn_run_with_rerun( sub {} )
  Like run_with_retry(), but run the block inside a transaction.
  svp_run( sub {} )
  Run a block of code inside a savepoint (no retry for savepoints).


Here are some of the names I've come up with so far:


#dbixc {
border-collapse: collapse;
border-right: 1px solid #CCC;
margin: 0 0 1em;
}

#dbixc th {
padding: 0 0.5em;
text-align: left;
border-left: 1px solid #CCC;
border-top: 1px solid #FB7A31;
border-bottom: 1px solid #FB7A31;
background: #FFC;
}

#dbixc td {
border-bottom: 1px solid #CCC;
padding: 0.5em;
border-left: 1px solid #CCC;
}


  
    Run block
    Run in txn
    Run in savepoint
    Run with retry
    Run in txn with retry
    Retry Mnemonic
  
  
    run
    txn_run
    svp_run
    runup
    txn_runup
    Run assuming the db is up, retry if not.
  
  
    run
    txn_run
    svp_run
    run_up
    txn_run_up
    Same as above.
  
  
    run
    txn_run
    svp_run
    rerun
    txn_rerun
    Run assuming the db is up, rerun if not.
  
  
    run
    txn_run
    svp_run
    run::retry
    txn_run::retry
    :: means ‚Äúwith‚Äù
  


That last one is a cute hack suggested
by Rob Kinyon on IRC. As you can see, I'm pretty consistent
with the non-retrying method names; it's the methods that retry that I'm not
satisfied with. A approach I've avoided is to use an adverb for the non-retry
methods, mainly because there is no retry possible for the savepoint methods,
so it seemed silly to have svp_run_safely() to
complement do_safely() and txn_do_safely().

title@Database Handle and Transaction Management with DBIx::Connector
body¢\As part of my ongoing effort to wrestle Catalyst into working the way
that I think it should work, I've just
uploaded DBIx::Connector to the CPAN. See, I
was using Catalyst::Model::DBI, but it turned
out that I wanted to use the database handle in places other than the Catalyst
parts of my app. I was bitching about this to 
mst on #catalyst,
and he said that Catalyst::Model::DBI was actually a fork of DBIx::Class's
handle caching, and quite out of date. I said, ‚ÄúBut this already exists. It's
called connect_cached().‚Äù I believe his response was,
‚ÄúOH FUCK OFF!‚Äù

So I started digging into what Catalyst::Model::DBI and DBIx::Class do to
cache their database handles, and how it differs from
connect_cached(). It turns out that they were pretty smart, in
terms of checking to see if the process had forked or a new thread had been
spawned, and if so, deactivating the old handle and then returning a new one.
Otherwise, things are just cached. This approach works well in Web
environments, including under mod_perl;
in forking applications, like POE apps; and in plain Perl scripts. Matt said he'd
always wanted to pull that functionality out of DBIx::Class and then make
DBIx::Class depend on the external implementation. That way everyone could
take advantage of the functionality, including people like me who don't want
to use an ORM.

So I did it. Maybe it was crazy (mmmmm‚Ä¶yak meat), but I can now use the
same database interface in the Catalyst and POE parts of my application
without worry:


my $dbh = DBIx::Connector->connect(
    'dbi:Pg:dbname=circle', 'postgres', '', {
        PrintError     => 0,
        RaiseError     => 0,
        AutoCommit     => 1,
        HandleError    => Exception::Class::DBI->handler,
        pg_enable_utf8 => 1,
    },
);

$dbh->do($sql);


But it's not just database handle caching that I've included in
DBIx::Connector; no, I've also stolen some of the transaction management stuff
from DBIx::Class. All you have to do is grab the connector object which
encapsulates the database handle, and take advantage of
its txn_do() method:


my $conn = DBIx::Connector->new(@args);
$conn->txn_do(sub {
    my $dbh = shift;
    $dbh->do($_) for @queries;
});


The transaction is scoped to the code reference passed to
txn_do(). Not only that, it avoids the overhead of calling
ping() on the database handle unless something goes wrong. Most
of the time, nothing goes wrong, the database is there, so you can proceed
accordingly. If it is gone, however, txn_do() will re-connect and
execute the code reference again. The cool think is that you will never notice
that the connection was dropped -- unless it's still gone after the second
execution of the code reference.

And finally, thanks to some pushback from mst,
ribasushi, and others, I added
savepoint support. It's a little different than that provided
by DBIx::Class; instead of relying on a magical auto_savepoint
attribute that subtly changes the behavior of txn_do(), you just
use the svp_do() method from within txn_do(). The
scoping of subtransactions is thus nicely explicit:


$conn->txn_do(sub {
    my $dbh = shift;
    $dbh->do('INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (1)');
    eval {
        $conn->svp_do(sub {
            shift->do('INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (2)');
            die 'OMGWTF?';
        });
    };
    warn "Savepoint failed\n" if $@;
    $dbh->do('INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (3)');
});


This transaction will insert the values 1 and 3, but not 2. If you call
svp_do() outside of txn_do(), it will call
txn_do() for you, with the savepoint scoped to the entire
transaction:


$conn->svp_do(sub {
    my $dbh = shift;
    $dbh->do('INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (4)');
    $conn->svp_do(sub {
        shift->do('INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (5)');
    });
});


This transaction will insert both 3 and 4. And note that you can nest
savepoints as deeply as you like. All this is dependent on whether
the database supports savepoints; so far, PostgreSQL, MySQL (InnoDB),
Oracle, MSSQL, and SQLite do. If you know of others, fork the
repository, commit changes to a branch, and send me a pull
request!

Overall I'm very happy with this module, and I'll probably use it in all my
Perl database projects from here on in. Perhaps later I'll build a model class
on it (something like Catalyst::Model::DBI, only better!), but next up, I plan
to finish documenting
Template::Declare and writing some
views with it. More on that soon.

titleSVN::Notify 2.0 Hitting CPAN
bodyùcMy latest Perl module, SVN::Notify 2.00, has hit CPAN. This is a port of my widely-used activitymail CVS notification script to Subversion. But it underwent quite a few changes over the port, including:


  Modularization
  The old monolithic activitymail script is gone. It has been replaced with a Perl class, SVN::Notify, that does most of the work. The new script, svnnotify, is essentially just a wrapper around the class; all it does is process command-line arguments and then pass the results to SVN::Notify.

  Simplification
  Subversion's system for hooking in to commit transactions is far better thought-out than that of CVS. It's now easy to capture the results of an entire commit in a single transaction, without having to write out temp files to keep track of where we are and to concatenate diffs. As a result, SVN::Notify has a much simpler architecture and implementation that requires fewer third-party modules to do its work. In addition, the move to a class should make it much easier to build on SVN::Notify in the future than it was with activitymail. Autrijus Tang already suggested a number of ideas on IRC, including SVN::Notify::Jabber or SVN::Notify::Export. Have at it, everyone!

  Reduced Resource Usage
  I had heard some complaints that, on very large commits, activitymail could end up taking up a huge amount of memory. As best I could figure, this was because it was loading everything into memory, including the diff for the commit! SVN::Notify avoids this problem by using a file handle to read in a diff an print it to sendmail one line at a time. This should keep resource usage by SVN::Notify way below what activitymail used.

  Context-Specific Notifications
  SVN::Notify has added support for mapping email addresses to regular expressions. Whenever a regular expression matches the name of one or more of the directories affected in a single commit, the corresponding email address will be added to the list of recipients of the notification. This is a great way to get notification messages sent to particular email addressed based on what part of the Subversion tree was affected by a commit. I intend to use this to set it up so that a list of translators only get notification about a commit when it changes a directory related to localization in my projects, so that they can ignore commits to other parts of the application.


These are the major changes, but SVN::Notify also features a number of smaller improvements over its activitymail ancestor, including character set support, user domain support for the From header, explicit specification of a From header, properly escaped content when sending HTML-formatted notifications, and a maximum subject length configuration.

So what did it lose? Just a few things:


  syncmail-like behavior. Did anyone ever use this? If so, feel free to implement SVN::Notify::Syncmail.
  Arguments to diff. SVN::Notify just uses svnlook diff to generate a diff. Support for other diffs could be added in a future version, if people really need it.
  New directories and imports can no longer be ingored, because in Subversion they're really no different from any other commit.
  Limit on the maximum size of the email. This is because SVN::Notify no longer loads the entire email into memory to measure it.
  Excluding certain files from the diff. Subversion handles this itself by paying attention to the media type of each file.
  Windows support. Actually, I'm not sure if activitymail was ever used on Windows, but the new method of using pipes to communicate with other processes isn't supported by Windows, as near as I can tell. There are comments in the code for those who wish to do the port; it would probably be easy using Win32::Process.


Not too much, eh? Let me know what you think, and send feedback!

titleSVN::Notify 2.50
bodyôSVN::Notify 2.50 is currently making its way to CPAN. It has quite a number of changes since I last wrote about it here, most significantly the slick new CSS treatment introduced in 2.47, provided by Bill Lynch. I really like the look, much better than it was before. Have a look at the SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff output to see what I mean. Be sure to make your browser window rally narrow to see how all of the sections automatically get a nice horizontal scrollbar when they're wider than the window. Neat, eh? Check out the 2.40 output for contrast.

Here are all of the changes since the last version:



  2.50  2005-11-10T23:27:22
  
    
      Added --ticket-url and --ticket-regex
        options to be used by those who want to match ticket identifers for
        systems other than RT, Bugzilla, GNATS, and JIRA. Based on a patch
        from Andrew O'Brien.
      Removed bogus use lib line put
        into Makefile.PL by a prerelease version of Module::Build.
      Fixed HTML tests to match either '
        or &#39;, since HTML::Entities can be configured
        differently on different systems.
    
  

  2.49  2005-09-29T17:26:14
  
    
      Now require Getopt::Long 2.34 so that
        the --to-regex-map option works correctly when it is used
        only once on the command-line.
    
  

  2.48  2005-09-06T19:14:35
  
    
      Swiched from <span class="add"> and
        <span class="rem">
        to <ins> and <del> elements in
        SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff in order to make the markup more
        semantic.
    
  

  2.47  2005-09-03T18:54:43
  
    
      Fixed options tests to work correctly with older versions of
        Getopt::Long. Reported by Craig McElroy.
      Slick new CSS treatment used for the HTML and HTML::ColorDiff emails.
        Based on a patch from Bill Lynch.
      Added --svnweb-url option. Based on a patch from
      Ricardo Signes.
    
  

  2.46  2005-05-05T05:22:54
  
    
      Added support for Copied files to HTML::ColorDiff so that
        they display properly.
    
  

  2.45  2005-05-04T20:38:18
  
    
      Added support for links to
        the GNATS bug tracking system. Patch from Nathan
        Walp.
    
  

  2.44  2005-03-18T06:10:01
  
    
      Fixed Name in POD so that SVN::Notify's POD gets indexed by
        search.cpan.org. Reported by Ricardo Signes.
    
  

  2.43  2004-11-24T18:49:40
  
    
      Added --strip-cx-regex option to strip out parts of the
        context from the subject. Useful for removing parts of the file names
        you might not be interested in seeing in every commit message.
      Added --no-first-line option to omit the first sentence
        or line of the log message from the subject. Useful in combination
        with the --subject-cx option.
    
  

  2.42  2004-11-19T18:47:20
  
    
      Changed Files to Paths in hash returned by
        file_label_map() since directories can be listed as well
        as files.
      Fixed SVN::Notify::HTML so that directories listed among the
        changed paths are not links.
      Requiring Module::Build 0.26 to make sure that the installation
        works properly. Reported by Robert Spier.

title'SVN::Notify 2.22 Improves Diff Parsing
bodyÜI released SVN::Notify 2.22 last night. The new version fixes a few issues in the parsing of diffs in the HTML subclasses. SVN::Notify::HTML now properly identifies added, deleted, and property setting sections of an included diff file when creating IDs. The lists of the affected files near the top of the email links down into the diff, and now also includes links to the locations in the diff for files that have had only their properties changed.

SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff had similar updates. It now properly outputs added and deleted files in the diff in separate sections, instead of grouping them under the last modified file listed. It also creates separate sections for files that have only had their properties changed. I've put an example here.

Grab the new version from CPAN now

titleTemplate::Declare Explained
body¢ Today, Sartak uploaded a new version of
Template::Declare.
Why should you care? Well, in addition to the
nice templating syntax,
the new version features complete documentation. For everything.

This came about because I was trying to understand Template::Declare, with its
occasional mentioning of ‚Äúmixins‚Äù and ‚Äúpaths‚Äù and ‚Äúroots,‚Äù and I just wasn‚Äôt
getting it out of the
existing documentation.
Much of my confusion stemmed from how
Catalyst::View::Template::Declare
used Template::Declare. So I started peppering
Jesse with
questions and offering to fill in some gaps in the docs, and he was foolish
enough to give me a commit bit.

I was particularly interested in the import_templates and alias methods.
There was no documentation, and though there were tests, the two methods were
so similar that I could barely tell the difference. I also wasn‚Äôt sure what
the point was, though I had ideas. So I asked a bunch of
questions
and, through the discussion, I started to put the pieces together. I wrote
more tests, and started refactoring things. I'd write some code, rename
things, move them around, combine things, and then see who screamed. Jesse and
Sartak were happy to run the Jifty test suite and even, I think, some
Best Practical internal stuff to see what I
broke. And then I'd think I got things just right and they would punch holes
in it again.

But it finally came together, I understood what the methods were trying to do,
and I documented the shit out of it. Then Sartak would copy-edit my docs,
verifying my interpretations, and help me to understand where I got things
wrong.

The new version features a glossary (useful for users of other templating
packages) and extended examples that demonstrate XUL output, postprocessing,
inheritance, and wrappers. And, most importantly, an explanation of aliasing
(think delegation) and mixins (using the new name for import_templates:
mix). I greatly appreciate the time the BPS team took to answer my noobish
questions. And their patience as I ripped things apart and built them up
again. The result is that, in addition to being better documented, the new
version‚Äôs alias method creates build much better-performing and less
memory-intensive aliases.

So why was I doing all this? Well,
Catalyst::View::Template::Declare
never seemed quite right to me. And in my discussions with the Jifty guys, it
seemed clear that its use of Template::Declare was trying to alias
kinda sorta, but not really. So as I tried to understand aliasing, I realized
that a new view class was needed for catalyst. So I endeavored to really
understand the features of Template::Declare so that I could do it right.

More news on that soon.

The upshot is that you have pretty nice control over mixing and aliasing
Template::Declare templates into paths. For example, if you have this template
class:


package MyApp::Templates::Util;
use base 'Template::Declare';
use Template::Declare::Tags;

template header => sub {
    my ($self, $args) = @_;
    head { title {  $args->{title} } };
};

template footer => sub {
    div {
        id is 'fineprint';
        p { 'Site contents licensed under a Creative Commons License.' }
    };
};


You can mix those templates into your primary template class like so:

package MyApp::Templates::Main;
use base 'Template::Declare';
use Template::Declare::Tags;
use MyApp::Template::Util;
mix MyApp::Template::Util under '/util';

template content => sub {
    show '/util/header';
    body {
        h1 { 'Hello world' };
        show '/util/footer';
    };
};


See how I've used the mixed in header and footer templates by referring to
them under the /util path? This gives the invocation of the other templates
the feel of calling
Mason components or
invoking
Template Toolkit
templates. You can use these templates like so:


Template::Declare->init( dispatch_to => ['MyApp::Templates::Main'] );
print Template::Declare->show('/content');


So MyApp::Templates::Main‚Äôs templates are in the ‚Äú/‚Äù directory, so to speak,
while the MyApp::Templates::Util‚Äôs templates are in the ‚Äú/utils‚Äù
subdirectory. Pretty cool, eh?

So with this understanding in place, I had a much better feel for
Template::Declare, and could better think of it in normal templating terms.
Now I'm this much closer to my ideal Catalyst development environment. More
soon.

title6SVN::Notify 2.41 Adds Plain Text Issue Tracking Links
bodyü I expect that this will be my last release of SVN::Notify for a while. I've already spent more time on it than I had anticipated. But anyway, this is a pretty solid release. It doesn't change the API or anything, but I feel that the jump from 2.30 to 2.40 is justified because of the sheer number of changes. From now on, I expect that it will mostly be maintenance, like 2.41, which fixes a minor formatting bug. Grab it now from CPAN.

First, I've added a new, complex example of the SVN::Notify::HTML::ColorDiff output that I will keep up-to-date with all future changes. This will allow people to get a better idea of what it's capable of than my previous contrived examples allowed.

The biggest change is that I've moved the Request Tracker, Bugzilla, and JIRA support from SVN::Notify::HTML to SVN::Notify. I realized, after the release of 2.30, that it might be cool to add links to the text-only email message generated by SVN::Notify, too. So I've done that, including for ViewCVS links. Unlike in SVN::Notify::HTML, the links won't be inline in the message (that doesn't work too well in plain text, IMO), but will come in their own sections after the message. So you'll get something like this (extreme example):

Log Message:
-----------
Let's try a few links to other applications. First, we have
A Bugzilla Bug # 709. Then we have a JIRA key, TST-1608. And
finally, we have an RT link to Ticket # 4321.

Hey, we could add one to ViewCVS for a Subversion Revision
#606, too!

ViewCVS Links:
-------------
    http://viewsvn.bricolage.cc/?rev=606&view=rev

Bugzilla Links:
--------------
    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=709

RT Links:
--------
    http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?id=4321

JIRA Links:
----------
    http://jira.atlassian.com/secure/ViewIssue.jspa?key=TST-1608


The nice thing is that, for many mail clients, these will be turned into clickable links. You'll also notice that the text that creates the ViewCVS link is split over two lines. This is new in this release, and works for SVN::Notify::HTML, too. I made a few other tweaks to the regular expressions, as well. Here's a complete list of changes:


  Fixed accessor generation so that accessors created for the
        attributes passed to register_attributes() but a subclass are
        created in the subclass' package instead of in SVN::Notify.
  Changed parsing for JIRA keys to use any set of capital letters
        followed by a dash and then a number, rather than the literal
        string JIRA- followed by a number. Reported by Garrett Rooney.
  Modified the regular expression patterns for the RT, Bugzilla,
        RT, and ViewCVS links to properly match on word boundaries, so
        that strings like humbug 12 don't match.
  Modified the ViewCVS link regular expression pattern so that it
        matches strings like rev 12 as well as revision 12.
  Modified the RT link regular expression pattern so that it
        matches strings like RT-Ticket: 23 as well as Ticket 1234.
        Suggested by Jesse Vincent.
  Added complicated example to try to show off all of the major
        features. I will keep this up-to-date going forward in order to
        post sample output on the Web.
  Fixed the parsing of log messages so that empty lines are no
        longer eliminated.
  HTML::ColorDiff now properly handles the listing of binary files
        in the diff, marking them with a new class, binary, and using
        the same CSS as is used for the propset class.
  In HTML::ColorDiff, Fixed CSS for the delfile class to properly
        wrap it in a border like the other files in the diff.
  Added labels to the HTML::ColorDiff diff file sections to indicate
        the type of change (Modified, Added, Deleted, or Property
        changes).
  Moved the rt_url, bugzilla_url, and jira_url parameters from
        SVN::Notify::HTML to SVN::Notify, where they are used to add URLs
        to the text version of log messages.

title&SVN::Notify 2.10 Generalizes Behavior
bodyñAIt's all Autrijus' fault.

As I mentioned last week when I released SVN::Notify 2.0, Autrijus has suggested using SVN::Notify as the base class for modules that do other things, such as send instant messages or update a checkout for backup purposes. Instantly seeing the value in this, I further realized that I could greatly simplify the support for HTML notification emails by moving the HTML-specific code to a subclass and then just let polymorphism do the work.

The result SVN::Notify 2.10. To simplify the move to a subclass for the HTML notifications, I broke up the old send() method into a large number of other methods that affect various parts of the composition of the email, such as headers, starting the message, outputting the log message, the file list, and outputting or attaching the diff. Then I just overrode the few methods that need different behavior in the subclass, and it all worked!

I realized, as I worked on it, I also realized that I was following the same principals that Ovid has written about with regard to the use of if. I was able to remove quite a few of them by moving HTML to a subclass. Of course, there are still some to enable diffs to be either included in an email or attached, but I didn't want to split things up too much, or I'd have a geometric explosion of subclasses!

The svnnotify script, in the meantime, remains largely unmodified. The only change is the deprecation of the --format option in favor of a new option, --handler. Use this option to specify what subclass of SVN::Notify should handle the notification. So far, there's just one, --format HTML, but I'm sure that Autrijus will soon add --format Jabber, and I'd like to add --format HTML::ColorDiff, myself. I might have to move the processing of command-line arguments out of svnnotify and into SVN::Notify, instead, so that subclasses can add new options. We'll see what comes up.

Other changes to SVN::Notify include:


  Added code to Build.PL to set the shebang line in the test
        scripts. Reported by Robert Spier.
  Changed name of attached diff file to be named for the revision
        and the committer, rather than the committer and the date.
        Suggested by Robert Spier.
  Added Author, Date, and Revision information to the top of each
        message.
  The ViewCVS URL is no longer output for each file. A single link
        for the entire revision number is put at the top of the email,
        instead. ViewCVS Revision URL syntax pointed out by Peter
        Valdemar Morch.
  Changed the send() method to execute() to better reflect
        its generalized use as the method that executes actions in
        response to Subversion activity.
  The tests no longer require HTML::Entities to run. The HTML
        email tests will be skipped if it is not installed.
  Added accessor methods for the attributes of SVN::Notify.

title*DBIx::Connector Exception Handling Design
body†_In response to a bug report, I removed the documentation suggesting that one use the catch function exported by Try::Tiny to specify an exception-handling function to the DBIx::Connector execution methods. When I wrote those docs, Try::Tiny's catch method just returned the subroutine. It was later changed to return an object, and that didn't work very well. It seemed a much better idea not to depend on an external function that could change its behavior when there is no direct dependency on Try::Tiny in DBIx::Connector. I removed that documentation in 0.43. So instead of this:

$conn->run(fixup => sub {
    ...
}, catch {
    ...
});


It now recommends this:

$conn->run(fixup => sub {
    ...
}, catch => sub {
    ...
});


Which frankly is better balanced anyway.

But in discussion with Mark Lawrence in the ticket, it has become clear that there's a bit of a design problem with this approach. And that problem is that there is no try keyword, only catch. The fixup in the above example does not try, but the inclusion of the catch implicitly makes it behave like try. That also means that if you use the default mode (which  can be set via the mode method), then there will usually be no leading keyword, either. So we get something like this:

$conn->run(sub {
    ...
}, catch => sub {
    ...
});


So it starts with a sub {} and no fixup keyword, but there is a catch keyword, which implicitly wraps that first sub {} in a try-like context. And aesthetically, it's unbalanced.

So I'm trying to decide what to do about these facts:


The catch implicitly makes the first sub be wrapped in a try-type context but without a try-like keyword.
If one specifies no mode for the first sub but has a catch, then it looks unbalanced.


At one level, I'm beginning to think that it was a mistake to add the exception-handling code at all. Really, that should be the domain of another module like Try::Tiny or, better, the language. In that case, the example would become:

use Try::Tiny;
try {
    $conn->run(sub {
        ...
    });
} catch {
  ....
}


And maybe that really should be the recommended approach. It seems silly to have replicated most of Try::Tiny inside DBIx::Connector just to cut down on the number of anonymous subs and indentation levels. The latter can be got round with some semi-hinky nesting:

try { $conn->run(sub {
    ...
}) } catch {
    ...
}


Kind of ugly, though. The whole reason the catch stuff was added to DBIx::Connector was to make it all nice and integrated (as discussed here). But perhaps it was not a valid tradeoff. I'm not sure.

So I'm trying to decide how to solve these problems. The options as I see them are:


Add another keyword to use before the first sub that means "the default mode". I'm not keen on the word "default", but it would look something like this:

$conn->run(default => sub {
    ...
}, catch => sub {
    ...
});


This would provide the needed balance, but the catch would still implicitly execute the first sub in a try context. Which isn't a great idea.
Add a try keyword. So then one could do this:

$conn->run(try => sub {
    ...
}, catch => sub {
    ...
});


This makes it explicit that the first sub executes in a try context. I'd also have to add companion try_fixup, try_ping, and try_no_ping keywords. Which are ugly. And furthermore, if there was no try keyword, would a catch be ignored? That's what would be expected, but it changes the current behavior.
Deprecate the try/catch stuff in DBIx::Connector and eventually remove it. This would simplify the code and leave the responsibility for exception handling to other modules where it's more appropriate. But it would also be at the expense of formatting; it's just a little less aesthetically pleasing to have the try/catch stuff outside the method calls. But maybe it's just more appropriate.


I'm leaning toward #3, but perhaps might do #1 anyway, as it'd be nice to be more explicit and one would get the benefit of the balance with catch blocks for as long as they're retained. But I'm not sure yet. I want your feedback on this. How do you want to use exception-handling with DBIx::Connector? Leave me a comment here or on the ticket.

titleNew LDAP Auth Module for RT
bodyÜnI grabbed the LdapOverlay solution for using an LDAP server to authenticate against Request Tracker today in my continuing efforts to use LDAP for single sign-on for all Kineticode resources. It worked great, but I wanted a couple more things out of it, namely TLS communications with the LDAP server (so that all communications are encrypted), and authentication only for members of a certain LDAP group.

So I refactored LdapOverlay and added these features. You can download it from here. Just set the $LdapTLS variable in your RT_SiteConfig module to a true value to use TLS (but be sure that you also have Net::SSLeay installed!). If you want to allow only members of a certain LDAP group to authenticate to RT, set the DN of the group in the $LdapGroup variable, and set the name of the member attribute (usually uniqueMember) in the $LdapGroupAttribute variable.

Enjoy!

bodyÑ(So I just had a need to use DBI::Shell with a subclass of the DBI. It doesn't support subclasses directly (it'd be nice to be able to specify one on the command-line or something), but I was able to hack it into using one anyway by doing this:


use My::DBI;
BEGIN {
    sub DBI::Shell::Base::DBI () { 'My::DBI' };

Yes, it's extremely sneaky. DBI::Shell::Base uses the string constant DBI, as in DBI->connect(...), so by shoving a constant into DBI::Shell::Base before loading DBI::Shell, I convince it to use my subclass, instead.

title#Create a Template::Declare Wrapper
body≤Next in my ongoing series of posts on using Catalyst with Template::Declare and DBIx::Connector, we pick up again in chapter 3 to create a wrapper for the view. I added the wrapper support to Template::Declare over a year ago, and while the idea is sound, the interface makes it feel like it‚Äôs bolted on. See if you agree with me.

Returning to the MyApp project, open lib/MyApp/Templates/HTML.pm and implement a wrapper like so:


use Sub::Exporter -setup => { exports => [qw(wrapper) ] };

create_wrapper wrapper => sub {
    my ($code, $c, $args) = @_;
    xml_decl { 'xml', version => '1.0' };
    outs_raw '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" '
           . '"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">';
    html {
        head {
            title { $args->{title} || 'My Catalyst App!' };
            link {
                rel is 'stylesheet';
                href is $c->uri_for('/static/css/main.css' );
            };

        };

        body {
            div {
                id is 'header';
                # Your logo can go here.
                img {
                    src is $c->uri_for('/static/images/btn_88x31_powered.png');
                };
                # Page title.
                h1 { $args->{title} || $c->config->{name} };
            }; # end header.

            div {
                id is 'bodyblock';
                div {
                    id is 'menu';
                    h3 { 'Navigation' };
                    ul {
                        li {
                            a {
                                href is $c->uri_for('/books/list');
                                'Home';
                            };
                        };
                        li {
                            a {
                                href is $c->uri_for('/');
                                title is 'Catalyst Welcome Page';
                                'Welcome';
                            };
                        };
                    };
                }; # end menu

                div {
                    id is 'content';
                    # Status and error messages.
                    if (my $msg = $args->{status_msg}) {
                        span { class is 'message'; $msg };
                    }
                    if (my $err = $args->{error_msg}) {
                        span { class is 'error'; $err };
                    }

                    # Output the template contents.
                    $code->($args);
                }; # end content

            }; # end bodyblock
        };
    };
};



This looks like more work than it is because of the copious use of whitespace I've used. Personally, I find the pure Perl syntax easier to read than the mix of HTML and TT syntax in the Template Toolkit wrapper. Anyway, this is a nearly direct port of the Template Toolkit wrapper from the tutorial. Template::Declare wrappers expect at least one argument: a code reference that will output the content of the main template. You can see it used here near the end of the code, with the line $code->($args).

Unfortunately, Template::Declare doesn‚Äôt make such wrappers easily available to templates. So we have to add the Sub::Exporter line at the top to export the wrapper function it creates, named wrapper.

Next, open up lib/MyApp/Templates/HTML/Books.pm  and edit the list template to take advantage of the wrapper. The new code looks like this:


use MyApp::Templates::HTML 'wrapper';

template list => sub {
    my ($self, $args) = @_;
    wrapper {
        table {
            row {
                th { 'Title'  };
                th { 'Rating' };
                th { 'Author' };
            };
            my $sth = $args->{books};
            while (my $book = $sth->fetchrow_hashref) {
                row {
                    cell { $book->{title}  };
                    cell { $book->{rating} };
                    cell { $book->{author} };
                };
            };
        };
    } $self->c, $args;
};



First we import the wrapper function from MyApp::Templates::HTML, and then we simply use it to wrap the contents of our template. Note that the context object and template arguments must be passed on to the wrapper; they're not provided to the wrapper by Template::Declare. That‚Äôs something else I'd like to adjust.

In the meantime, contrary to the tutorial, I don‚Äôt think the template should set the title of the page. It seems to me that‚Äôs more the responsibility of the controller. So while this template could easily add a title key to the $args hash before passing it on to the wrapper, I recommend editing the list action in MyApp::Controller::Books instead:


sub list : Local {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;
    my $stash = $c->stash;
    $stash->{title} = 'Book List';
    $stash->{books} = $c->conn->run(fixup => sub {
        my $sth = $_->prepare('SELECT isbn, title, rating FROM books');
        $sth->execute;
        $sth;
    });
}



So, with the wrapper in place, let‚Äôs create the stylesheet the wrapper uses:


$ mkdir root/static/css



Then open root/static/css/main.css and add the following content:


#header {
  text-align: center;
}
#header h1 {
  margin: 0;
}
#header img {
  float: right;
}
#footer {
  text-align: center;
  font-style: italic;
  padding-top: 20px;
}
#menu {
  font-weight: bold;
  background-color: #ddd;
  float: left;
  padding: 0 0 50% 5px;
}
#menu ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  font-weight: normal;
  background-color: #ddd;
  width: 100px;
}
#content {
  margin-left: 120px;
}
.message {
  color: #390;
}
.error {
  color: #f00;
}



Now restart the app as usual and reload the books list at http://localhost:3000/books/list. You should now see a nicely formatted page with the navigation and header stuff, as well as the book list. You can  change the CSS and the wrapper to modify the overall look of your site, and then use the wrapper in all of your page request templates to get the same look and feel across your site.

While this works, I'm not satisfied with the overall interface for Template::Declare wrappers. The need to explicitly export them and pass arguments is annoying. Maybe the Jifty guys have some other approach that works better. But if not, I'll likely go back to the drawing board on wrappers and see how they can be made better.

Next up: More database fun!

title4Catalyst with DBIx::Connector and Template::Declare
bodyª~Following up on my post yesterday introducing Catalyst::View::TD, today I'd like to continue with the next step in chapter 3 of the Catalyst tutorial. The twist here is that I'm going to use PostgreSQL for the database back-end and start introducing some database best practices. I'm also going to make use of my DBIx::Connector module to interact with the database.

Create the Database

Picking up with the database creation section of the tutorial, the first change I'd like to make is to use a natural key for the books table. All books have unique identifiers, known as ISBNs, so creating a surrogate key (the typical id column in ORM-managed applications) is redundant. One of the nice things about PostgreSQL is that it ships with a contributed library, isn, which validates ISBN and other international identifiers. So we use this contrib module (usually included in package-installed PostgreSQL servers) for the primary key for books. If you need to install it from source, it‚Äôs pretty easy:


cd postgresql-8.4.1/contrib/isn
make
make install



Ideally I'd use a natural key for the authors table too, but despite some attempts to create universal identifiers for authors, nothing has really caught on as far as I know. So I'll just stick to a surrogate key for now.

First step: create the database and install isn if it‚Äôs not already included in the template database:


createdb -U postgres myapp
psql -U postgres -d myapp -f /usr/local/pgsql/share/contrib/isn.sql



The isn.sql file may be somewhere else on your system. Now let‚Äôs create the database. Create sql/001-books.sql in the MyApp directory and paste this into it:


BEGIN;

CREATE TABLE books (
    isbn   ISBN13   PRIMARY KEY,
    title  TEXT     NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    rating SMALLINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (rating BETWEEN 0 AND 5)
);

CREATE TABLE authors (
    id         BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    surname    TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    given_name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);

CREATE TABLE book_author (
    isbn       ISBN13 REFERENCES books(isbn),
    author_id  BIGINT REFERENCES authors(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (isbn, author_id)
);

INSERT INTO books
VALUES ('1587201534',        'CCSP SNRS Exam Certification Guide', 5),
       ('978-0201633467',    'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1',       5),
       ('978-0130183804',    'Internetworking with TCP/IP Vol.1',  4),
       ('978-1-56592-243-3', 'Perl Cookbook',                      5),
       ('978-0735712010',    'Designing with Web Standards',       5)
;

INSERT INTO authors
VALUES (1, 'Greg',      'Bastien'),
       (2, 'Sara',      'Nasseh'),
       (3, 'Christian', 'Degu'),
       (4, 'Richard',   'Stevens'),
       (5, 'Douglas',   'Comer'),
       (6, 'Tom',       'Christiansen'),
       (7, 'Nathan',    'Torkington'),
       (8, 'Jeffrey',   'Zeldman')
;

INSERT INTO book_author
VALUES ('1587201534',        1),
       ('1587201534',        2),
       ('1587201534',        3),
       ('978-0201633467',    4),
       ('978-0130183804',    5),
       ('978-1-56592-243-3', 6),
       ('978-1-56592-243-3', 7),
       ('978-0735712010',    8)
;

COMMIT;



Yeah, I Googled for the ISBNs for those books. I found the ISBN-13 number for most of them, but it handles the old ISBN-10 format, too, automatically upgrading it to ISBN-13. I also added a CHECK constraint for the rating column, to be sure that the value is always BETWEEN 0 AND 5. I also like to include default values where it‚Äôs sensible to do so, and that syntax for inserting multiple rows at once is pretty nice to have.

Go ahead and run this against your database:

psql -U postgres -d myapp -f sql/001-books.sql


Now if you connect to the server, you should be able to query things like so:


$ psql -U postgres myapp
psql (8.4.1)
Type "help" for help.

myapp=# select * from books;
       isbn        |               title                | rating

Setup the Database Connection

Great! The database is set. Now we need a way for the app to talk to it. I've not yet decided how I'm going to integrate DBIx::Connector into a Catalyst model class; maybe I'll figure it out as I write these posts. But since my mantra is ‚Äúthe database is the model,‚Äù for now I won‚Äôt bother with a model at all. Instead, I'll create a simple accessor in MyApp so we can easily get at the database connection wherever we need it. To do that, add these lines to lib/MyApp.pm:


use Moose;
use DBIx::Connector;
use Exception::Class::DBI;

has conn => (is => 'ro', lazy => 1, default => sub {
    DBIx::Connector->new( 'dbi:Pg:dbname=myapp', 'postgres', '', {
        PrintError     => 0,
        RaiseError     => 0,
        HandleError    => Exception::Class::DBI->handler,
        AutoCommit     => 1,
        pg_enable_utf8 => 1,
    });
});



We load Moose to get the has keyword, the officially sanctioned interface for defining attributes in Catalyst classes. Then I use that keyword to create the conn attribute. This attribute is read-only and has a DBIx::Connector object for its default value. The nice thing about this is that the DBIx::Connector object won‚Äôt be instantiated until it‚Äôs actually needed, and then it will be kept forever. We never have to do anything else to use it.

Oh, and I like to make sure that text data coming back from PostgreSQL is properly encoded as UTF-8, and I like to use Exception::Class::DBI to turn DBI errors into exception objects.

Now it‚Äôs time to update our controller and template to fetch actual data from the database. Edit lib/MyApp/Controller/Books.pm and change the list method to:


sub list : Local {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;
    $c->stash->{books} = $c->conn->run(fixup => sub {
        my $sth = $_->prepare('SELECT isbn, title, rating FROM books');
        $sth->execute;
        $sth;
    });
}



All we're doing here is creating a statement handle for the query, executing the query, and storing the statement handle in the stash. Now we need to update the template to use the statement handle. Open up lib/MyApp/Templates/HTML/Books.pm and change the list template to:


template list => sub {
    my ($self, $args) = @_;
    table {
        row {
            th { 'Title'  };
            th { 'Rating' };
            th { 'Author' };
        };
        my $sth = $args->{books};
        while (my $book = $sth->fetchrow_hashref) {
            row {
                cell { $book->{title}  };
                cell { $book->{rating} };
                cell { $book->{author} };
            };
        };
    };
};



All we do is fetch each row from the statement handle and output it. The only thing that‚Äôs changed is the use of the statement handle as an iterator rather than an array reference.

And now we're set! Restart your server with script/myapp_server.pl and point your browser at http://localhost:3000/books/list. Now you should see the book titles and ratings, though the authors still aren‚Äôt present. We'll fix that in a later post.

Takeaway

The takeaway from this post: Use PostgreSQL‚Äôs support for custom data types to create validated natural keys for your data, and use a stable, persistent database connection to talk directly to the database. No need for an ORM here, as the DBI provides a very Perlish access to a very capable DSL for models called SQL.

title.My Catalyst Tutorial: Add Authors to the View
body∆?Another post in my ongoing series of posts on using Catalyst with Template::Declare and DBIx::Connector. This will be the last post covering material from chapter 3, I promise. This is a fun one, though, because we continue to use this really nice DSL called ‚ÄúSQL,‚Äù which I think is more expressive than an ORM would be.

To whit, the next task is to add the missing list of authors to the book list. The thing is, the more I work with databases, the more I'm inclined to think about them not only as the ‚ÄúM‚Äù in ‚ÄúMVC‚Äù, but also the ‚ÄúV‚Äù. I'll show you what I mean.

A Quick Fix

But first, a diversion. In the second post in this series, I created an SQL statement to insert book authors, but I made a mistake: the values for surnames and given names were reversed. Oops. Furthermore, I included explicit author IDs, even though the id column uses a sequence for it‚Äôs default value. So first we need to fix these issues. Change  the INSERT INTO authors statement in sql/001-books.sql to:


INSERT INTO authors (surname, given_name)
VALUES ('Bastien',      'Greg'),
       ('Nasseh',       'Sara'),
       ('Degu',         'Christian'),
       ('Stevens',      'Richard'),
       ('Comer',        'Douglas'),
       ('Christiansen', 'Tom'),
       ('Torkington',   'Nathan'),
       ('Zeldman',      'Jeffrey')
;



This time, we're letting the sequence populate the id column. Fortunately, it starts from 1 just like we did, so we don‚Äôt need to update the values in the INSERT INTO book_author statement. Now let‚Äôs fix the database:

DELETE FROM book_author;
DELETE FROM authors;


Then run the above SQL query to restore the authors with their proper names, and then run the INSERT INTO book_author statement. That will get us back in business.

Constructing our Query

Now it‚Äôs time for the fun. The original SQL query we wrote to get the list of books was:

SELECT isbn, title, rating FROM books;


Nothing unusual there. But to get at the authors, we need to join to book_author and from there to authors. Our first cut looks like this:

SELECT b.isbn, b.title, b.rating, a.surname
  FROM books       b
  JOIN book_author ba ON b.isbn       = ba.isbn
  JOIN authors     a  ON ba.author_id = a.id;


Which yields this data:


       isbn        |               title                | rating |   surname

Good start, but note how we now have three rows for ‚ÄúCCSP SNRS Exam Certification Guide‚Äù and two for ‚ÄúPerl Cookbook‚Äù. We could of course modify our Perl code to look at the ISBN in each row and combine as appropriate, but it‚Äôs better to get the database to do that work, since it‚Äôs designed for that sort of thing. So let‚Äôs use an aggregate function to combine the values over multiple rows into a single row. All we have to do is use the column that changes (surname) in an aggregate function and tell PostgreSQL to use the other columns to group rows into one. PostgreSQL 8.4 introduces a really nice aggregate function, array_agg(), for pulling a series of strings together into an array. Let‚Äôs put it to use:

SELECT b.isbn, b.title, b.rating, array_agg(a.surname) as authors
  FROM books       b
  JOIN book_author ba ON b.isbn     = ba.isbn
  JOIN authors     a  ON ba.author_id = a.id
 GROUP BY b.isbn, b.title, b.rating;


Now the output is:


       isbn        |               title                | rating |          authors

Much better. We now have a single row for each book, and the authors are all grouped into a single column. Cool. But we can go one step further. Although we could use Perl to turn the array of author surnames into a comma-delimited string, there‚Äôs a PostgreSQL function for that, too: array_to_string(). Check it out:

SELECT b.isbn, b.title, b.rating,
       array_to_string(array_agg(a.surname), ', ') as authors
  FROM books       b
  JOIN book_author ba ON b.isbn     = ba.isbn
  JOIN authors     a  ON ba.author_id = a.id
 GROUP BY b.isbn, b.title, b.rating;


Now the rows will be:


       isbn        |               title                | rating |          authors

Create a Database View

Cool! All the formatting work is done! But since it‚Äôs likely what we'll often need to fetch book titles along with their authors, let‚Äôs create an SQL view for this query. That way, we don‚Äôt have to write the same SQL in different places in the application: we can just use the view. So create a new file, sql/002-books_with_authors.sql, and add this SQL:

CREATE VIEW books_with_authors AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.title, b.rating,
       array_to_string(array_agg(a.surname), ', ') as authors
  FROM books       b
  JOIN book_author ba ON b.isbn     = ba.isbn
  JOIN authors     a  ON ba.author_id = a.id
 GROUP BY b.isbn, b.title, b.rating;


Now install this view in the database:

psql -U postgres -d myapp -f sql/002-books_with_authors.sql


And now we can make use of the view any time we want and get the results of the full query. It‚Äôs time to do that in our controller. Edit lib/MyApp/Controller/Books.pm and change this line  in the list action:

my $sth = $_->prepare('SELECT isbn, title, rating FROM books');


To:

my $sth = $_->prepare(q{
    SELECT isbn, title, rating, authors FROM books_with_authors
});


The use of the q{} operator is a style I use for SQL queries in Perl code; you can use whatever style you like. Since this is a very short SQL statement (thanks to the view), it‚Äôs not really necessary to have it on multiple lines, but I like to be fairly consistent about this sort of thing.

The last thing we need to do is a a very simple change to the list template in lib/MyApp/Templates/HTML/Books.pm. In previous posts, I was referring to the non-existent ‚Äúauthor‚Äù key in the each hash reference fetched from the database. In the new view, however, I've named that column ‚Äúauthors‚Äù. So change this line:

cell { $book->{author} };


To

cell { $book->{authors} };


And that‚Äôs it. Restart the server and reload http://localhost:3000/books/list and you should now see all of the books listed with their authors.

Notes

I think you can appreciate why, to a certain degree, I'm starting to think of the database as handling both the ‚ÄúM‚Äù and the ‚ÄúV‚Äù in ‚ÄúMVC‚Äù. It‚Äôs no mistake that the database object we created is known as a ‚Äúview‚Äù. It was written in such a way that it not only expressed the relationship between books and authors in a compact but clear way, but it formatted the appropriate data for publishing on the site‚Äîall in a single, efficient query. All the Template::Declare view does is wrap it all up in the appropriate HTML.

PostgreSQL isn‚Äôt the only database to support feature such as this, by the way. All of the databases I've used support views, and many offer useful aggregate functions, as well. Among the MySQL aggregates, for example, is group_concat(), which sort of combines the array_to_string(array_agg()) PostgreSQL syntax into a single function. And I've personally written a custom aggregate for SQLite in Perl. So although I use PostgreSQL for these examples and make use of its functionality, you can do much the same thing in most other databases.

Either way, I find this to be a lot less work than using an ORM or other abstraction layer between my app and the database. Frankly, SQL provides just the right level of abstraction.

title)Testing Catalyst Template::Declare Views
body‡NNow that we have our default Catalyst tests passing, let's have a look at testing the views we've created. You can follow along via the Part 6 tag tag in the GitHub repository. Start by looking at the default test script for our HTML view, t/view_HTML.t. It should look something like this:


use strict;
use warnings;
use Test::More tests => 3;
# use Test::XPath;

BEGIN {
    use_ok 'MyApp::View::HTML' or die;
    use_ok 'MyApp' or die;
}

ok my $view = MyApp->view('HTML'), 'Get HTML view object';

# ok my $output = $view->render(undef, 'hello', { user => 'Theory' }),
#     'Render the "hello" template';

# Test output using Test::XPath or similar.
# my $tx = Test::XPath->new( xml => $output, is_html => 1);
# $tx->ok('/html', 'Should have root html element');
# $tx->is('/html/head/title', 'Hello, Theory', 'Title should be correct');


Yeah, this looks a bit different that the view test created for Template Toolkit or Mason views. That's because Catalyst::View::TD ships with its own test script template. One of the advantage is that it shows off testing the view without having to instantiate the entire app or send mock HTTP requests. These are unit tests, after all: we want to make sure that the view templates do what they want, not test an entire request process. The latter is more appropriate for integration tests, which I'll cover later.

So let's have a look at this test script. The first commented-out statement is:


# ok my $output = $view->render(undef, 'hello', { user => 'Theory' }),
#     'Render the "hello" template';


What this is showing us is that one can use the view's render() method to execute a view without a context object, thus saving the expense of initializing the application. And if you have templates that don't rely on it, I highly recommend this approach for keeping your tests fast. Even if the use of the the context object is fairly minimal, you can use Test::MockObject to mock up a context object like so:


use Test::MockObject;
my $c = Test::MockObject->new;
$c->mock(uri_for => sub { $_[1] });
$c->mock(config  => sub { { name => 'MyApp' } });
$c->mock(debug   => sub { });
$c->mock(log     => sub { });

ok my $output = $view->render($c, 'hello', { user => 'Theory' }),
     'Render the "hello" template';


Then you can use the mock() method to mock more methods as your template uses them.

Alas, our app has already passed the point where that seems worthwhile. So far we have just one template, books/list, and it requires that there also be a database statement handle available. Sure we could create a database connection and prepare a statement handle. But that would start to require a fair bit more code to set up. So let's just instantiate the application object and be done with it. Change the test plan to 5:


use Test::More tests => 5;


Then change the test body after the BEGIN block to:


# Instantiate the context object and the view.
ok my $c = MyApp->new, 'Create context object';
ok my $view = $c->view('HTML'), 'Get HTML view object';

# Create a statement handle for books/list.
my $sth = $c->conn->run(sub { $_->prepare(q{
    SELECT isbn, title, rating, authors FROM books_with_authors
}) });
$sth->execute;

# Render books/list.
ok my $output = $view->render($c, 'books/list', {
    title => 'Book List',
    books => $sth,
}), 'Render the "books/list" template';


This allows us to get a full test of the view.

Result: PASS


Hrm. Those warnings are rather annoying. Looking at Catalyst.pm I see that they come from the uri_for() method. I expect that they somehow result from a lack of state in the context object. That's not really important for our unit tests, so let's just mock that one method to do something reasonable. Add this code after instantiating the context object but before rendering the view:


use Test::MockObject::Extends;
my $mocker = Test::MockObject::Extends->new($c);
$mocker->mock( uri_for => sub { $_[1]} );


And now we get:


% prove --lib --verbose t/view_HTML.t
t/view_HTML.t .. 
1..5
ok 1 - use MyApp::View::HTML;
ok 2 - use MyApp;
ok 3 - Create context object

All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=5,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr  0.01 sys +  0.77 cusr  0.07 csys =  0.87 CPU)
Result: PASS


Ah, much better! And thanks to our mock, we also have a much better idea of what will be returned from uri_for(), which will be important for later tests.

Now that we have things properly mocked up and the objects created such that we can actually get the template to render, it's time to test the output from the template. For HTML and XML format, I like the Test::XPath module. In fact, it's for this very use that I wrote Test::XPath. It's great because it allows me to effectively test the correctness of the template output. Here's the basic outline:


# Test output using Test::XPath.
my $tx = Test::XPath->new( xml => $output, is_html => 1);
test_basics($tx, 'Book List');

# Call this function for every request to make sure that they all
# have the same basic structure.
sub test_basics {
    my ($tx, $title) = @_;

    # Some basic sanity-checking.
    $tx->is( 'count(/html)',      1, 'Should have 1 html element' );
    $tx->is( 'count(/html/head)', 1, 'Should have 1 head element' );
    $tx->is( 'count(/html/body)', 1, 'Should have 1 body element' );

    # Check the head element.
    $tx->is(
        '/html/head/title',
        $title,
        'Title should be corect'
    );
    $tx->is(
        '/html/head/link[@type="text/css"][@rel="stylesheet"]/@href',
        '/static/css/main.css',
        'Should load the CSS',
    );
}


I've set up the test_basics() function to test the things that should be mostly the same for every request. This will mainly cover the output of the wrapper, and includes things like making sure that there is just one <html> tag, one <head> tag, and one <body> tag; and that the title and CSS-related elements are output properly. Running this (with the test plan set to no_plan as I develop), I get:


% prove --lib t/view_HTML.tt
t/view_HTML.t .. 2/? 
#   Failed test 'Should load the CSS'
#   at t/view_HTML.t line 52.

Hrm. Let's stick a diag $output in there and see what we get. Now the output includes this bit:


# <html>
#  <head>
#   <title>Book List</title>
#   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/main.css" />
#  </head>


Ah! the <link> element for the stylesheet is missing the type attribute. So let's add it. Edit lib/MyApp/Templates/HTML.pm and change the proper bit of the wrapper template to:


link {
    rel is 'stylesheet';
    type is 'text/css';
    href is $c->uri_for('/static/css/main.css' );
};


Note the addition of the type attribute. Now when we run the tests (removing the diag), we get:


% prove --lib t/view_HTML.t
t/view_HTML.t .. ok    
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=10,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr  0.00 sys +  0.78 cusr  0.07 csys =  0.87 CPU)
Result: PASS


Ah, much better! A lot more testing should go in there to make sure that the wrapper is doing things right. I've committed such testing, so check it out.

Now we need to test the output specific to the books/list template. Below the call to test_bascis(), add this code:


$tx->ok('/html/body/div[@id="bodyblock"]/div[@id="content"]/table', sub {
    $_->is('count(./tr)', 6, 'Should have seven rows' );
    $_->ok('./tr[1]', sub {
        $_->is('count(./th)', 3, 'Should have three table headers');
        $_->is('./th[1]', 'Title', '... first is "Title"');
        $_->is('./th[2]', 'Rating', '... second is "Rating"');
        $_->is('./th[3]', 'Authors', '... third is "Authors"');
    }, 'Should have first table row')
}, 'Should have a table');


Notice the nested block there? Test::XPath supports passing blocks to its ok() method, so that you can naturally scope your tests to blocks of XML and HTML. Neat, huh? If you don't like the use of $_, the test object is also passed as the sole argument to such blocks.

Anyway, these tests makes sure that the table is where it should be, has the proper number of rows, and that the first row has three headers with their proper values. The test outputs:


% prove --lib t/view_HTML.tt
t/view_HTML.t .. 1/? 
#   Failed test '... third is "Authors"'
#   at t/view_HTML.t line 42.
#          got: 'Author'
#     expected: 'Authors'
# Looks like you failed 1 test of 28.
t/view_HTML.t .. Dubious, test returned 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
Failed 1/28 subtests 

Test Summary Report
-------------------
t/view_HTML.t (Wstat: 256 Tests: 28 Failed: 1)
  Failed test:  28
  Non-zero exit status: 1
Files=1, Tests=28,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.03 usr  0.01 sys +  0.79 cusr  0.08 csys =  0.91 CPU)
Result: FAIL


Whoops! Looks like I forgot to change the header when I changed the template to output a list of authors last week. So edit lib/MyApp/Templates/HTML/Books.pm and change the template to output "Authors" instead of "Author":


row {
    th { 'Title'   };
    th { 'Rating'  };
    th { 'Authors' };
};


And now all tests pass again:


% prove --lib t/view_HTML.t
t/view_HTML.t .. ok    
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=28,  1 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr  0.01 sys +  0.78 cusr  0.09 csys =  0.90 CPU)
Result: PASS


Great. So let's finish testing the rest of the output. Ah, but wait! We have on ORDER BY clause on the query, so the order in which the books will be output is undefined. So let's add an ORDER BY clause. Change the creation of the statement handle in the test file to:


my $sth = $c->conn->run(sub { $_->prepare(q{
    SELECT isbn, title, rating, authors
      FROM books_with_authors
     ORDER BY title
}) });


And now you can start to see why I use the q{} operator for SQL queries. You should also note that the inputs for the view test are now different than those from the controller, which still has no ORDER BY clause. It's likely that we'll want to go back and change that later, but I bring it up here to highlight the difference from integration tests -- and to emphasize that we'll need to write those integration tests at some point!

But back to the view unit tests. We can now test the contents of the table by adding code after the test for ./tr[1]. Here's what the test for the next row looks like:


$_->ok('./tr[2]', sub {
    $_->is('count(./td)', 3, 'Should have three cells');
    $_->is(
        './td[1]',
        'CCSP SNRS Exam Certification Guide',
        '... first is "CCSP SNRS Exam Certification Guide"'
    );
    $_->is('./td[2]', 5, '... second is "5"');
    $_->is(
        './td[3]',
        'Bastien, Nasseh, Degu',
        '... third is "Bastien, Nasseh, Degu"',
    );
}, 'Should have second table row');


The other rows can be similarly tested; have a look at the commit to see all the new tests.

This reminds me, however, that we never created an order for the list of authors. So it's possible that this test could fail, as the order of the author last names is undefined. We should go back and fix that, probably by listing the authors as they are actually listed on the cover of the book. But in the meantime, our test of this view is done.

Next up, I think I'll hit controller tests. So come on back!

body±bYet another entry in my ongoing attempt to rewrite the Catalyst tutorial in my own coding style.

So far, I've been following the original tutorial pretty closely. But now I want to skip ahead a bit to chapter 8: testing. I skip because, really, we should be writing tests from the very beginning. They shouldn‚Äôt be an afterthought stuck in the penultimate chapter of a tutorial. So let‚Äôs write some tests. You can follow along in the Part 5 tag in the GitHub repository.

Oops, A Missing Dependency

Oh, wait! I forgot to tell the build system that we now depend on Catalyst::View::TD and DBIx::Connector. So add these two lines to Makefile.PL:


requires 'Catalyst::View::TD' => '0.11';
requires 'DBIx::Connector' => '0.30';



Okay, now we can write some tests.

STFU

Well, no, actually, let‚Äôs start by running the tests we have:


perl Makefile.PL
make test



You should see some output after this ‚Äî lots of stuff, actually ‚Äî ending something like this:

I don‚Äôt know about you, but having all that debugging crap just drives me nuts while I'm running tests. It‚Äôs helpful while doing development, but mainly just gets in the way of the tests. So let‚Äôs get rid of them. Open up lib/MyApp.pm and change the use Catalyst statement to:


use Catalyst (qw(
    ConfigLoader
    Static::Simple
    StackTrace
), $ENV{HARNESS_ACTIVE} ? () : '-Debug');



Essentially, we're just turning on the debugging output only if the test harness is not active. Now when we run the tests, we get:


t/01app.t ............. ok   
t/02pod.t ............. skipped: set TEST_POD to enable this test
t/03podcoverage.t ..... skipped: set TEST_POD to enable this test

Much better. Now I can actually see other stuff, such as the fact that I'm skipping POD tests. Personally, I like to make sure that POD tests run all the time, as I'm likely to forget to set the environment variable. So let‚Äôs edit t/02pod.t and t/03podcoverage.t and delete this line from each:


plan skip_all => 'set TEST_POD to enable this test' unless $ENV{TEST_POD};



So what does that get us?


t/01app.t ............. ok

Well that figures, doesn‚Äôt it? We added the list action to  MyApp::Controller Books but never documented it. And for some reason, Catalyst creates the default action in MyApp::Controller::Root with no documentation. Such a shame. So let‚Äôs document those methods. Add this to t/lib/MyApp/Controller/Root.pm:


=head2 default

The default action. Just returns a 404/NOT FOUND error. Might want to update
later with a template to format the error like the rest of our site.

=cut



While there, I notice that the index action has a doc header, but nothing to actually describe what it does. Let‚Äôs fix that, too:


The default Catalyst action, which just displays the welcome message. This is
the "Yay it worked!" page. Consider changing to a real home page for our app.



Great. Now open t/lib/MyApp/Controller/Books.pm and document the list action:


=head2 list

Looks up all of the books in the system and executes a template to display
them in a nice table. The data includes the title, rating, and authors of each
book

=cut



Oh hey, look at that. There‚Äôs an index method that doesn‚Äôt do anything. And it has a POD header and no docs, too. So let‚Äôs document it:


The default method for the books controller. Currently just says that it
matches the request; we'll likely want to change it to something more
reasonable down the line.



Okay, so how do the tests look now?


t/01app.t ............. ok   
t/02pod.t ............. ok     
t/03podcoverage.t ..... ok   
t/controller_Books.t .. ok

Files=5, Tests=25,  3 wallclock secs ( 0.05 usr  0.02 sys +  2.82 cusr  0.31 csys =  3.20 CPU)
Result: PASS



Excellent! Now, the truth is that we didn‚Äôt document our templates, either. Test::Pod doesn‚Äôt cotton on to that fact because they're not installed like normal subroutines in the test classes. So it‚Äôs up to us to document them ourselves. (Note to self: Consider adding a module to test that all Template::Declare classes have docs for all of their templates.) I'll wait here while you do that.

All done? Great! I had actually planned to start testing the view next, but I think this is enough for today. Stay tuned for more testing goodness.

title-Create Catalyst Views with Template::Declare
body§Following up on last week‚Äôs
release of
Template::Declare
0.41, this week I'm pleased to announce the release of a new
Catalyst view class,
Catalyst::View::TD.

Yes, I'm aware of
Catalyst::View::Template::Declare.
As I mentioned
last week, it doesn‚Äôt make very good use of Template::Declare. I don‚Äôt blame
jrock for that, though; Template::Declare had very
poor documentation before 0.41. But now that it is properly documented and I
have a pretty solid grasp of how it works, I wanted to create a new Catalyst
View that could take proper advantage of its features.

If you're a Catalyst developer, chances are that you currently use
Template Toolkit
or Mason
for your templating needs. So why should you consider
Catalyst::View::TD
for your next project? How about:


Feature-parity with Catalyst::View::TT, the view class for Template Toolkit
Includes a myapp_create.pl helper for creating new template classes.
Intuitive, easy-to-use HTML and XML templating in Perl
All templates loaded at server startup time (great for forking servers like mod_perl)
Template paths that correspond to Controller URIs.



If you weren‚Äôt convinced by the first three points, that forth one is the
killer. It‚Äôs the reason I wrote a new view. But here‚Äôs an even better reason:
I'm going to show you exactly how to use it, right here in this blog post.

A Simple Hello

I'm borrowing from
chapter 3
of the Catalyst tutorial. First, create a new app:


$ catalyst.pl MyApp
cd MyApp



Then update the list of plugins in MyApp.pm:


use Catalyst qw/
    -Debug
    ConfigLoader
    Static::Simple
    StackTrace
/;



Now create a controller:


$ script/myapp_create.pl controller Books



Then edit it and add this controller (see
chapter 3
if you need explanation about what this does):


sub list : Local {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;
    $c->stash->{books} = [];
    $c->stash->{template} = '/books/list';
}



And now, create a view and a new template class:


$ script/myapp_create.pl view HTML TD
$ script/myapp_create.pl TDClass HTML::Books



Open lib/MyApp/Templates/HTML/Books.pm and add the list template:


my ($self, $args) = @_;
table {
    row {
        th { 'Title'  };
        th { 'Rating' };
        th { 'Author' };
    };
    for my $book (@{ $args->{books} }) {
        row {
            cell { $book->{title}  };
            cell { $book->{rating} };
            cell { $book->{author} };
        };
    }
};



Then point your browser to http://localhost:3000/books/list. If you have
everything working so far, you should see a web page that displays nothing
other than our column headers for ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù, ‚ÄúRating‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAuthor(s)‚Äù ‚Äî we
won‚Äôt see any books until we get the database and model working below.

A Few Comments

The first thing I want to draw your attention to in this example is that
list template. Isn‚Äôt it a thing of beauty? It‚Äôs so easy for Perl hackers to
read. Compare it to the TT example from the tutorial (with the comments
removed, just to be fair):


<tr><th>Title</th><th>Rating</th><th>Author(s)</th></tr>
[% FOREACH book IN books -%]
  <tr>
    <td>[% book.title %]</td>
    <td>[% book.rating %]</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
[% END -%]
</table>



I mean, which would you rather have to maintain? And this is an extremely
simple example. The comparison only becomes more stark when the HTML becomes
more complex.

The other thing I want to point out is the name of the template
class we created, MyApp::Template::HTML::Books and its
template, list. They correspond perfectly with the
controller, MyApp::Controller::Books, and its action
list. See the parity there? The URI for the action is
/books/list, and the template path, by coincidence is
also /books/list. Nice, huh? Thanks to this parity, you
can even remove the template specification in the controller, since by
default Catalyst will render a template with the same name as the
action:


sub list : Local {
    my ($self, $c) = @_;
    $c->stash->{books} = [];
}



This is the primary way in which
Catalyst::View::TD
differs from its
predeceossor.
Whereas the latter would load all of the modules under the view‚Äôs namespace
and shove all of their templates into root path, the former imports templates
under paths that correspond to their class names. Hence the match with
controller names.

Stay Tuned

It was kind of fun to subvert the Catalyst tutorial for my nefarious purposes.
Maybe I'll keep it up with more blog posts in the coming weeks that continues
to do so. Not only will it let me show off how nice Template::Declare
templates can be, but it will let me continue my rant against ORMs as well.
Stay tuned.

The first escape appears to work correctly, but when I decode the string to Perl's Unicode representation, you can see how badly escape_html() munges the text!

Curiously, both tests fail, although the first conversion appears to be correct. This could be due to the behavior of eq, though I'm not sure why. But it's the second test that's the more interesting, since it really screws things up.

titleF<code>Module::Build</code> + <code>Apache::Test</code> is Nearly Here
bodyá+Over the last couple of days, I whipped up a new class to be added to
the Apache HTTP Test Project. The new class, Apache::TestMB,
is actually a subclass of Module::Build, and finally provides support
for using Apache::Test with Module::Build. You use 
it just like Module::Build; however, since a lot of modules
choose to install themselves even if Apache isn't installed (because they can
be used both inside and outside of mod_perl, e.g.,
HTML::Mason),
I'm suggesting that Build.PL files look like this:

use Module::Build;

my $build_pkg = eval { require Apache::TestMB }
  ? "Apache::TestMB" : "Module::Build";

my $build = $build_pkg->new(
  module_name => "My::Module",
)->create_build_script;

Pretty simple, huh? To judge by the discussion,
it will soon be committed to the Apache::Test repository and
released to CPAN. My MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks
module will debut with a new Apache::TestMB-powered Build.PL
soon afterward.

title&<code>Apache::TestMB</code> Released!
bodyîAs I mentioned last week,
I've been working on a subclass of Module::Build that supports testing with
Apache::Test. Today, Geoff announced the
release of Apache::Test 1.12. This release includes the
new Module::Build subclass, Apache::TestMB. Now
anyone using Apache::Test to test their module can convert the build
system to Module::Build.

To set an example, I've just released MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks using the new build
module. The conversion was simple; in fact, I think
that Apache::TestMBis easier to use
than Apache::TestMM (which integrates Apache::Test
with ExtUtils::MakeMaker). My Makefile.PL had looked like this:

#!perl -w

use strict;
use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
use File::Spec::Functions qw(catfile catdir);
use constant HAS_APACHE_TEST => eval {require Apache::Test};

# Set up the test suite.
if (HAS_APACHE_TEST) {
    require Apache::TestMM;
    require Apache::TestRunPerl;
    Apache::TestMM->import(qw(test clean));
    Apache::TestMM::filter_args();
    Apache::TestRunPerl->generate_script();
} else {
    print "Skipping Apache test setup.\n";
}

my $clean = join ' ', map { catfile('t', $_) }
  qw(mason TEST logs);

WriteMakefile(
    NAME		=> 'MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks',
    VERSION_FROM	=> 'lib/MasonX/Interp/WithCallbacks.pm',
    PREREQ_PM		=> { 'HTML::Mason'             => '1.23',
                                'Test::Simple'            => '0.17',
                                'Class::Container'        => '0.09',
                                'Params::CallbackRequest' => '1.11',
                              },
    clean               => { FILES => $clean },
    ($] >= 5.005 ?    ## Add these new keywords supported since 5.005
      (ABSTRACT_FROM    => 'lib/MasonX/Interp/WithCallbacks.pm',
       AUTHOR           => 'David Wheeler <david@kineticode.com>') : ()),
);


The new Build.PL simplifies things quite a bit. It looks like this:

use Module::Build;

my $build_pkg = eval { require Apache::TestMB }
  ? 'Apache::TestMB' : 'Module::Build';

$build_pkg->new(
    module_name        => 'MasonX::Interp::WithCallbacks',
    license            => 'perl',
    requires           => { 'HTML::Mason'             => '1.23',
                               'Test::Simple'            => '0.17',
                               'Class::Container'        => '0.09',
                               'Params::CallbackRequest' => '1.11'
                             },
    build_requires     => { Test::Simple => '0.17' },
    create_makefile_pl => 'passthrough',
    add_to_cleanup     => ['t/mason'],
)->create_build_script;


Much nicer, eh?

titleRuby Time Object Time Zone Bug
bodyäMThis is disappointing.

To summarize, Ruby's Time class has a bug in its zone method. The example is simple:


tz = ENV['TZ']
ENV['TZ'] = 'Africa/Luanda'
t = Time.now
puts t.zone
ENV['TZ'] = 'Australia/Lord_Howe'
puts t.zone


This outputs:


WAT
WAT


So far so good. But look what happens when I add a single line to the program, foo = t.to_s:


tz = ENV['TZ']
ENV['TZ'] = 'Africa/Luanda'
t = Time.now
puts t.zone
ENV['TZ'] = 'Australia/Lord_Howe'
foo = t.to_s
puts t.zone


The result changes:


WAT
LHST


This is clearly wrong. Changing the $TZ environment variable and stringifying the object should not change the underlying value of any of the object's attributes. The Time object should remember the value of the time zone when it is initialized, and should never change.

Unfortunately, The Ruby core developers (or at least the owner of the bug report) feel that, since Time relies on the system C API, and since time zones are a PITA, it's not worth it to change this behavior. The downside, however, is that you cannot rely on Time zones to ever be correct unless you're very, very careful.

Personally, in my subclass of Time, I took care of stashing the time zone at object instantiation as a workaround for this bug. It seemed reasonable to me, and I was just surprised that the idea was rejected by the Ruby developers.

What do you think?

titleArray to Hash One-Liner
bodyÜKProgramming in Ruby, I've badly missed Perl's list syntax, which, among other things, makes converting between arrays and hashes really easy. In Ruby I have forever been converting an array to a hash like this:


a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
h = {}
a.each { |v| h[v] = v }


Of course, this is anything bug concise. In Perl, I can just do this:


my @a = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
my %h = map { $_ => $_ } @a;


Easy, huh? Well, I finally got fed up with the nasty hack in Ruby, did a little Googling, and figured out a way to do it in a single line:


a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
h = Hash[ *a.collect { |v| [ v, v ] }.flatten ]


Not quite as consice as the Perl version, and I have to construct a bunch of arrays that I then throw away with the call to flatten, but at least it's concise and, I think, clearer what it's doing. So I think I'll go with that.

title0How do I Add apply() to IE JavaScript Functions
bodyåMThis is really bugging me. I've added a feature to my TestSimple JavaScript library where one can specify a function to which to send test output. It executes the function, along with an object, if necessary, by calling its apply() method. If you don't specify a function for output, it uses document.write by default:


if (!fn) {
    fn = document.write;
    obj = document;
}
var output = function () { fn.apply(obj, arguments) };


This works great in Firefox, as I can then just call fn.apply(this, arguments) and the arguments are properly passed on through to the function.

However, Internet Explorer doesn't seem to have an apply() method on its write() function. If I execute document.write.apply(document ['foo']) in Firefox, it outputs foo to the browser. In Internet Explorer for Windows, however, it yields an error: Object doesn't support this property or method. Wha??

I thought I could get around it by just adding the apply() method to document.write, but that doesn't work, either. This code:


document.write.apply = Function.prototype.apply;
document.write.apply(document, ['foo']);


Yields the same error. Curiously, so does this code:


document.write.apply2 = Function.prototype.apply;
document.write.apply2(document, ['foo']);


So it seems that assigning a function to document.write is a no-op in IE. WTF?

So does anyone know a workaround for this bug? I found a page that says, Beware that some native functions in IE were made to look like objects instead of functions. This might explain why apply() doesn't exist for the document.write object, but not why I can't add it.

Help!

el.innerHTML = "window.onload(null, Test);";


Firefox is still happy, but now IE 6 says, Unknown runtime error. If I try to just append a script tag to pre.innerHTML, I get no error, but the code doesn't seem to execute, either. In fact, pre.innerHTML appears to be empty!

title2Suggestion for Emulating Namespaces in JavaScript
body°=I've been giving some thought on how to emulate namespaces in JavaScript (at least until they're implemented in the language), and this is what I've come up with: use objects for namespaces. This was inspired by a glance at the prototype, where I noticed that Sam Stephenson was using objects to group related things into neat packages.

For example, say that you wanted to create a class for managing music on you CDs. Normally in JavaScript, you'd create a class named CDMusic. This is all well and fine, but if everyone creates classes with a single name, a JSAN repository would end with an awfully crowded list of classes. It allows for no effective hierarchical organization of code.

But if you use objects to represent namespaces, you can define a class something like this, instead (1990s-era example borrowed from Damian Conway's Object Oriented Perl):


if (CD == undefined) var CD = {}; // Make sure the base namespace exists.
CD.Music = function () {};        // Constructor definition.

// Class definition.
CD.Music.prototype = {
    name:      null,
    artist:    null,
    publisher: null,
    isbn:      null,
    tracks:    [],

    location: function (shelf, room) {
        if (room != null) this._room = room;
        if (shelf != null) this._shelf = shelf;
        return [this._room, this._shelf];
    },

    rating: function (rate) {
        if (rate != null) this._rating = rate;
        return this._rating;
    }
};


So now, to use this class, you just:


var music = new CD.Music();
music.name = "Renegades";
music.artist = "Rage Against the Machine";
music.tracks.push("Microphone Fiend");
music.location("basement", 3); // I use an iPod, so it's in storage!


Of course, the key part of this example is var music = new CD.Music();. Note how the class is defined as an attribute of the CD object. This allows us to have a namespace, CD.Music, that is subsumed under another namespace, namely CD. The nice thing about this is that, in the hypothetical JSAN repository, the class might be defined the file Music.js in the CD directory. A use() function as described by Michael Schwern might then be smart enough to look for /use/CD/Music.js when you write use("CD.Music").

I also kind of like how the use of the namespace and prototype allows my class definition to be indented by the creation of the prototype object. But to make these types of namespaces work, you must have that first statement: if (CD == undefined) var CD = {};. This allows you to assign to a CD object whether you have to create it (because your class stand on its own), or because some other JavaScript class has defined it. This is especially important to ensure that you don't stomp on someone else's work. Say someone is using two different JavaScript classes, your CD.Music and someone else's CD.Jukebox. The two classes might be completely unrelated to each other, but because they both define themselves under the CD top-level namespace using the if (CD == undefined) statement, they won't stomp on each other.

The only downside to this proposal, in my estimation, is the requirement it imposes for defining inherited classes. Say you wanted a subclass of CD.Music for classical music. You'd have to do it like this:


// CD.Music must be loaded already. Create the constructor.
CD.Music.Classical = function () {}

// Inherit from CD.Music.
CD.Music.Classical.prototype = new CD.Music(); // Inheritance.

So we don't get the block syntax, but in truth, that's no different from how one typically handles inheritance in JavaScript. The only difference is the use of the dot notation. Nevertheless, suggestions for how to use a block syntax would be warmly received.

So what do you think? Is this something that makes sense to you? Would you do it to better organize your JavaScript classes and modules (and yes, I am thinking that you could group functional libraries this way, too, and then implement an import() function to export functions to another namespace or the global object)? Leave your opinions in a comment. Thanks!

title6Is there a JavaScript Library Documentation Standard?
bodyçlIs there a JavaScript documentation standard? I've been working on a test framework for JavaScript and I'd like to integrate documentation so that others can use it.

If there isn't a documentation standard, I can see three possible options that I'd like to suggest:


  Use XHTML.
  Since JavaScript is mainly used for XHTML, it makes some sense to
  just use XHTML for its documentation. The downside to this is that there is
  currently no way to parse out the documentation, AFAIK. The format for
  putting the docs into comments would have to be standardized. I don't really
  see that happening.

  Use POD.
  JavaScript is a dynamic language; it'd make some sense to use the
  documentation format of an existing dynamic language. And POD is a proven
  format. The downside, of course, is that there is not a parser for pulling
  POD out of a .js file. Same problem as for XHTML,
  essentially.

  Use JavaDoc
  
    Since the syntax of JavaScript is roughly based on JavaScript, and
    JavaScript supports the same comment syntax, one could simply use the
    JavaDoc format. The javadoc application probably couldn't parse it
    out too well, since it parses the Java code (or byte code?) to
    automatically document method names, signatures, etc.

    But a quick Googling yields JSDoc as a possible solution. The only downside to the
    JavaDoc/JSDoc solution is that it tends to allow authors to be too lazy.
    Since the application automatically documents the existence of functions
    and their signatures, often little else is documented. But that's mainly a
    personal issue; I don't have to be so lazy in my own documentation! I
    think I'll give that a shot.
  


Meanwhile, if anyone knows of something better/more widely used, let me know!

title'Plea for Help from JavaScript Geniuses
bodyû5I've been working for some time to get pure .js test files working with Test.Simple. In principal, it's simple: The Browser harness simply constructs a hidden iframe, and if the test script ends in .js, it uses document.write() for that iframe to write out a new HTML document that includes the test script via a script tag. It can also load other scripts specified by the user in the index.html file that runs the harness.

I got it working, and then converted all of Test.Simple's own tests over to .js files, at which point it got all weird. The tests were dying after the third test file was loaded and run. After weeks of on and off debugging, I've reduced the problem enough to find the following:


  I'm using JSAN to load dependencies in the test scripts themselves. The browser harness loads it by writing a script tag into the head section of the iframe.
  The tests always use JSAN to load Test.Builder, either directly or by loading a library that depends on it (like Test.More.
  Test.Builder detects when it's being run in a browser and sets an onload event handler to end the execution of tests.
  For the first two test files, Test.Builder loads and runs, and sets up the onload event handler, and it properly executes when the test finish.
  But in the third test, the onload event handler seems to run before Test.Builder has finished execution or even loading! As such, it cannot get access to the Test.Builder class to finish the tests, and throws an exception: Error: this.Test has no properties, where this is the iframe window object.


The only thing I can guess is that it's retaining the onload event handler for the previous test file, even if I put delete buffer.onload before writing out the HTML to load the test file! (Note that buffer is the name of the variable that is holding the contentWindow attribute of the iframe object.) You can observe this behavior for yourself by running the tests now. They don't work in Safari at all (I code to Firefox and then port to the other browsers), but Firefox demonstrates the issue. I have alert()s that run just before Test.Builder sets up the onload event handler, and then inside the event handler, either when its run or when it catches an exception (but before it rethrows it). The order of execution, you'll note, is as follows:


  async.js.......... output to browser
  alert("Setup: buffer") during the execution of Test.Builder for async.js, where "buffer" is the name of the iframe element.
  alert("Onload: buffer") for async.js, during the execution of the onload event
  bad_plan.js....... output to browser
  alert("Setup: buffer") during the execution of Test.Builder for bad_plan.js
  alert("Onload: buffer") for bad_plan.js, during the execution of the onload event
  buffer.js........ output to browser
  alert("Catch: buffer") output from catching the exception in the onload handler for buffer.js, which, of course, Test.builder hasn't set up yet!


If I don't rethrow the exception, it then runs the code in Test.Builder that sets up the onload handler. In other words, the onload handler runs before it has been created. Huh?

The nearest to a workaround that I've found is to delete the iframe element after each test and create a new one. The errors are still thrown, but all tests seem to pass anyway. It doesn't seem to like the old-style .html test files, though; it hangs on them without throwing any error at all. Grrrr.

So, are you a JavaScript genius? Do you know how the browser, DOM, and frames work and interact better than you know your own family? If so, please, please give me a hint as to what I can do to fix this problem so that I can get a new version of Test.Simple out ASAP. Thanks!

Update: I forgot to mention that the in-progress source code for Test.Simple with support for .js test files can be downloaded here, so that you can play with it on your own system. Thanks!category$Computers | Programming | Javascript	timestamp

bodyòI'm pleased to announce the third alpha release of TestSimple, the port of
Test::Builder, Test::Simple, and Test::More to
JavaScript. You can download
it here. This release has the following
changes:


  Removed trailing commas from 3 arrays, since IE6/Win doesn't like
  them. And now everything works in IE. Thanks to Marshall Roch for tracking
  down and nailing this problem.
  isNum() and isntNum()
  in TestBuilder.js now properly convert values to numbers using the
  global Number() function.
  CurrentTest is now properly initialized to 0 when creating a new
  TestBuilder object.
  Values passed to like() and unlike() that are
  not strings now always fail to match the regular expression.
  plan() now outputs better error messages.
  isDeeply() now works better with circular and repeating
  references.
  diag() is now smarter about converting objects to strings
  before outputting them.
  Changed isEq() and isntEq() to use simple equivalence checks
  (== and !=, respectively) instead of stringified
  comparisons, as the equivalence checks are more generally
  useful. Use cmpOk(got, "eq", expect) to explicitly
  compare stringified versions of values.
  TestBuilder.create() now properly returns a new TestBuilder
  object instead of the singleton.
  The useNumbers(), noHeader(),
  and noEnding() accessors will now properly assign a non-null
  value passed to them.
  The arrays returned from summary()
  and details() now have the appropriate structures.
  diag() now always properly adds a # character after
  newlines.
  Added output(), failureOutput(),
  todoOutput(), warnOutput(),
  and endOutput() to TestBuilder to set up function reference to
  which to send output for various purposes. The first three each default
  to document.write, while warnOutput() defaults to
  window.alert and endOutout() defaults to the
  appendData function of a text element inside an element with
  the ID test or, failing that, window.write.
  todo() and todoSkip() now properly add #
  after all newlines in their messages.
  Fixed line ending escapes in diagnostics to be platform-independent. Bug
  reported by Marshall Roch.
  Ported about a third of the tests from Test::Simple (which is how I
  caught most of the above issues). The remaining test from Test::Simple will
  be ported for the next release.


Many thanks to Marshall Roch for help debugging issues in IE.

Now, there is one outstanding issue I'd like to address before I would
consider this production ready (aside from porting all the remaining tests
from Test::Simple): how to harness the output. Harnessing breaks down into a
number of issues:

How to run all tests in a single window. I might be able to write a build
script that builds a single HTML file that includes all the other HTML files
in iframes or some such. But then will each run in its own space without
stomping on the others? And how would the harness pull in the results of each?
It might be able to go into each of its children and grab the resultsfrom the
TestBuilder objects...


More Feedback/advice/insults welcome!

I'm pleased to announce the release of Test.Simple 0.11. This release fixes a number of bugs in the framework's IE and Safari support, adds JSAN support, and includes an experimental harness for Macromedia^Adobe Director. You can download it from JSAN, and all future releases will be available on JSAN. See the harness in action here (or verbosely!). This release has the following changes:


  The browser harness now works more reliably in IE and Safari.
  Fixed syntax errors in tests/harness.html that IE and Safari
      care about.
  Various tweaks for Director compatibility from Gordon McCreight.
  Removed debugging output from Test.More.canOK().
  Fixed default output so that it doesn't re-open a closed browser
      document when there is a test element.
  Added experimental Test.Harness.Director, complements of Gordon
      McCreight. This harness is subject to change.
  Added Test.PLATFORM, containing a string defining the
      platform. At the moment, the only platforms listed are browser or
      director.
  Added support for Casey
      West's JSAN. All releases of
      Test.Simple will be available on JSAN from now on.
  The iframe in the browser harness is no longer visible in
      IE. Thanks to Marshall Roch for the patch.
  Noted addition of Test.Harness and Test.Harness.Browser in the
      README.


I've been getting more and more excited about Casey West's work on JSAN. It gets better every day, and I hope that it attracts a lot of hackers who want to distribute open source JavaScript modules. You should check it out! I've been working on a Perl module to simplify the creation of JSAN distributions. Look for it on CPAN soonish.

title(JSDoc Doesn't Quite do the Trick for Me
bodyíTAfter my request for JavaScript documentation standards, I investigated the one I found myself: JSDoc. I went ahead and used its syntax to document a JavaScript class I'd written, and it seemed to work pretty well. Initially, my main complaint was that their was no easy way to include arbitrary documentation. Everything has to be associated with a constructor, attribute, or method. Bleh.

But then I started documenting two purely functional JavaScript files I'd written. These just create functions in the Global scope for general use. And here's where JSDoc started to really become a PITA. First, functions with the same names in the two files were declared to be pre-declared! They two files are part of the same project, but users will generally use one or the other, not both. But JSDoc has taken it upon itself to refuse to document functions that are in two different files in the same project. Surely that's the JavaScript interpreter's responsibility!

The next issue I ran into (after I commented out the code in JSDoc.pm that refused to document functions with the same names) was that it didn't recognize one of the files as having documentation, because there was no constructor. Well duh! A purely functional implementation doesn't have a constructor! It seems that Java's bias for OO-only implementations has unduly influenced JSDoc, even though JavaScript applications often define no classes at all!

The clincher in my decision to ditch JSDoc, however, came when I realized that, for most projects, I won't want the documentation in the same file as the code. While I generally prefer that they be in the same file, I will often have 4-10 times more documentation than actual code, and the bandwidth overhead seems unnecessary. JavaDoc and JSDoc of course require that any documentation be in the same files, since that's where they parse method signatures and such.

So I think I'll follow Chris Dolan's advice from my original post and fall back on Good 'ole POD. POD allows me to write as much or as little documentation as I like, with methods and functions documented in an order that makes sense to me, with headings even! I can write long descriptions, synopses, and even documentation completely unrelated to specifics of the interface. And all in a separate file, even!

This will do until someone formalizes a standard for JavaScript. Maybe it'll be KwiD?

titleTest.Simple 0.10 Released
body†bI‚Äôm pleased to announce the first beta release of Test.Simple, the port of Test::Builder, Test::Simple, Test::More, and Test::Harness to JavaScript. You can download it here. See the harness in action here (or verbosely!). This release has the following changes:


   Changed the signature of functions passed to output() and
        friends to accept a single argument rather than a list of
        arguments. This allows custom functions to be much simpler.
  Added support for Macromedia Director. Patch from Gordon McCreight.
  Backwards Incompatibility change: moved all modules into Test
        namespace by using an object for the Test namespace and
        assigning the Build() constructor to it. See
        http://xrl.us/fy4h for a description of this approach.
  Fixed the typeOf() class method in Test.Builder to just
        return the value returned by the typeof operator if the
        class constructor is an anonymous function.
  Changed for (var in in someArray) to
        for (var i = 0; i < someArray.length; i++) for iterating
        through arrays, since the former method will break if someone has
        changed the prototype for arrays. Thanks to Bob Ippolito for the
        spot!
  The default output in browsers is now to append to an element with the
        ID test or, failing that, to
        use document.write. The use of the
        test element allows output to continue to be written to the browser
        window even after the document has been closed. Reported by Adam
        Kennedy.
  Changed the default endOutput() method to be the same as
        the other outputs.
  Backwards incompatibility change: Changed semantics
        of plan() so that it takes an object for an argument.
        This allows multiple commands to be passed, where the object attribute
        keys are the command and their values are the arguments.
  Backwards incompatibility change: Changed
        the no_plan, skip_all, and no_diag (in Test.More
        only) options to plan() to their studlyCap
        alternatives, noPlan, skipAll, and noDiag. This
        makes them consistent with JavaScript attribute naming
        convention.
  Added beginAsync() and endAsync() methods to Test.Builder to allow
        users to put off the ending of a script until after asynchronous tests
        have been run. Suggested by Adam Kennedy.
  Backwards incompatibility change: Changed the signature for the
    output() method and friends to take only a single anonymous
        function as its argument. If you still need to call a method, pass an
        anonymous function that calls it appropriately.
  Changed handling of line-endings to be browser-specific. That is, if the
        current environment is Internet Explorer, we use \r for line
        endings.  Otherwise we use \n. Although IE properly interprets
        \n as a line ending when it's passed to document.write(),
        it doesn't when passed to a DOM text node. No idea why not.
  Added a browser harness. Now you can run all of your tests in a single
        browser window and get a summary at the end, including a list of
        failed tests and the time spent running the tests.
  Fixed calls to warn() in Test.More.
  Output to the browser now causes the window to scroll when the length of
        the output is greater than the height of the window.
  Backwards incompatibility change: Changed all instances of Ok to
        OK. So this means that the new Test.More function names are
        canOK(), isaOK(),
        and cmpOK(). Sorry 'bout that, won't happen again.
  Ported to Safari (though there are issues--see the Bugs section
        of the Test.Harness.Browser docs for details).


Obviously this is a big release. I bumped up the version number because there are a fair number of backwards incompatibilities. But I'm reasonably confident that they wont' change so much in the future. And with the addition of the harness, it's getting ready for prime time!

Next up, I'll finish porting the test from Test::Harness (really!) and add support for JSAN (look for a JSAN announcement soon). But in the meantime, feedback, bug reports, kudos, complaints, etc.warmly welcomed!

title*New JavaScript Testing Method: TestSimple
bodyó\I'm pleased to announce the first alpha release of my port of Test::Simple/Test::More/Test::Builder to JavaScript. Download it now and let me know what
you think!

You can see what the tests look like by loading the files in
the tests/ directory into your Web browser. This is my first stab at
what I hope becomes a complete port. I could use some feedback/ideas on a
number of outstanding issues:


  I have made no decisions as to where to output test results,
  diagnostics, etc. Currently, they're simply output to document.write(). This
  may well be the best place in the long run, though it might be nice to allow
  users to configure where output goes. It will also be easy to control the
  output, since the output functions can easily be replaced in JavaScript.
  Suggestions welcome.

  I have no idea how to exit execution of tests other than by throwing an
  exception, which is only supported by JavaScript 1.5, anyway, AFAIK. As a
  result, skipAll(), BAILOUT(),
  and skipRest() do not work.

  Skip and Todo tests currently don't work because named blocks (e.g.,
  SKIP: and TODO:) are lexical in JavaScript.
  Therefore I cannot get at them from within a function called from within a
  block (at least not that I can tell). It might be that I need to just pass
  function references to skip() and todo(), instead.
  This is a rather different interface than that supported by Test::More, but
  it might work. Thoughts?

  Currently, one must call Test._ending() to finish running
  tests. This is because there is no END block to grab on to in
  JavaScript. Suggestions for how to capture output and append the output of
  _ending() are welcome. It might work to have
  the onload event execute it, but then it will have to look for
  the proper context in which to append it (a <pre> tag, at
  this point).

  Anyone have any idea how to get at the line number and file name in a
  JavaScript? Failures currently aren't too descriptive. As a result, I'm not
  sure if level() will have any part to play.

  Is there threading in JavaScript?

  I haven't written TestHarness yet. It may not make sense to even have
  such a thing in JavaScript; I'm not sure.

  I'm using a Module::Build
  script to build a distribution. I don't think there's a standard for
  distributing JavaScript libraries, but I think that this works reasonably
  well. I have all of the documentation in POD, and the script generates HTML
  and text versions before creating the tarball. The Build.PL script
  of course is not included in the distribution. I started out trying to write
  the documentation in JSDoc, but abandoned it for all of the reasons I recounted last
  week.

  Is there a way to dynamically load a JavaScript file? I'd like to use an
  approach to have TestMore.js and TestSimple.js
  load TestBuilder.js. I'd also like to use it to
  implement loadOk() (equivalent to
  Test::More's use_ok() and
  require_ok() subroutines).


More details are in the ToDo section of the TestBuilder docs.

Let me know what you think!

title)Quirks of IE's JavaScript Implementation
bodyêJust a few notes about the quirks of IE's JavaScript implementation that I
had to figure out and work around to
get TestSimple working in IE.:


  
    IE doesn't like serial commas. In other words, If I create an object
  like this:
    var obj = {
    foo: "yow",
    bar: "bat",
};

    IE will complain. It seems it doesn't like that last comma, but it
    doesn't give you a decent diagnostic message to help you figure out that
    that's what it doesn't like. Fortunately, I didn't have to figure this one
    out; Marshall did And now I know to expect that IE
    thinks that its JavaScript should parse like SQL. Whatever!
  
  
    You can't truncate an array using a single argument
      to splice().  In Firefox, ary.splice(0) will
      truncate the array, but in IE, you must provide the second argument,
      like this: ary.splice(0, ary.length)‚Äîor else it
      won't actually truncate the array.
  
  
    Many IE JavaScript functions don't seem to actually inherit from the
    Function class! I discovered this when I tried to
    call document.write.apply() and it failed. Not only
    does the apply() method not exist, but I can't even add it!  I
    came up with a decent workaround for this problem in TestBuilder, but I
    still don't have a general solution to the problem. I did
    find a page that might
    have a general solution, but it sure is ugly.
  
  
    IE automatically converts line endings in to the platform specific
    alternatives whenever you assign a JavaScript string to a text element.
    When Marshall showed me output that wasn't properly adding # after
      all line endings, this was my immediate suspicion, and a quick Googling
      confirmed the
      issue. So I had to add regular expressions to look for all
      variations on the line endings.
  


I'm sure I'll notice other issues as I work more with JavaScript, but feel
free to chime in here with any gotchas you've noticed, and then I won't have
to work so hard to figure them out on my own in the future (and neither will
you)!

titleThe Purpose of TestSimple
body£2In response to my TestSimple 0.03 announcement, Bill N1VUX asked a number of important questions about TestSimple's purpose. Since this is just an alpha release and I'm still making my way though the port, I haven't created a project page or started to promote it much, yet. Once I get the harness part written and feel like it's stable and working well, I'll likely start to promote it as widely as possible.

But yes, TestSimple is designed for doing unit testing in JavaScript. Of all the JavaScript I've seen, I've never seen any decent unit tests. People sometimes write a few integration tests to test them in browsers, but don't write many tests that would ensure that their JS code runs where they need it to run and that would give them the freedom to refactor. There is generally very little coverage in JavaScript tests‚Äîif there are any tests at all.

While it's true that JavaScript is nearly always an embedded language (but see also Rhino and SpiderMonkey), that doesn't mean that one doesn't write a lot of JavaScript functions or classes that need testing. It's also important to have a lot of tests you can run in various browsers (just as you can run tests of a Perl module on various OSs and various versions of Perl). I started the port because, as I was learning JavaScript, I realized that I didn't want to write much without writing tests. The purpose is to ensure the quality of JavaScript code as it goes through the development process. And the freedom to refactor that tests offer is very important for my personal development style.

So, to answer N1VUX's questions:

Is the point to integration test the whole distributed front-ends of applications from the (EcmaScript compliant) browser?

Yes. And I expect that, as people write more JavaScript applications, there will be a lot more code that needs testing. However, unlike other JavaScript testing frameworks I've seen (all based on the xUnit framework), my suite doesn't assume that tests will be run in a browser. Ultimatelly, I'd like to be able to automate tests outside of browsers‚Äîor by scripting browsers. But in the meantime, it will produce TAP-compliant output in the browser, and I plan on implementing a harness that will run all of your test scripts in a single browser window and output the results, just like Test::Harness does for Perl modules on the command-line.

Or to unit test the client-side java-script as an entity, mocking the server??

Yes, I would like to be able to do that eventually. I will likely mock the server by mocking XMLHttpRequest and Microsoft.XMLHTTP to return XML strings that can be used for testing. Stuff like that.

Or is the point to Unit test JavaScript functions in the browser in vitro, mocking everything outside the current function?

If need be, yes. The point is that you have the freedom to do it the way that makes sense to your particular project. The testing framework itself doesn't care where it's run or how.

Or is this for Unit Testing of the Presentation Layer on the server from the Browser? (If so, how can a JavaScript arrange to Mock the Model layer?)

Probably not, but again, it depends on the model of your application. I've tried to make no assumptions, just provide you with the tools to easily test your application. I hope and expect that others will start creating the appropriate JavaScript libraries to start mocking whatever other APIs one needs to fully unit test JavaScript code that relies on such libraries.

Or is it more likely for driving Integration Testing from the browser with the scripting simplicity we've come to love, without resorting to OLE-stuffing the browser from Perl?

That was my initial impetus, yes.

Digging into the TAR file (which I normally wouldn't do before peaking at the web copy of the POD2HTML's) I think I understand it's for unit-testing JavaScript classes, which I hadn't even considered. (JavaScript has classes that fancy? *shudder* no wonder pages don't work between browser versions.) I hope I don't need to do that.

Yes, as more people follow Google's lead, more and more applications will be appearing in JavaScript, and they will require a lot of code. JavaScript already suppports a prototype-based object-orientation scheme, and if JavaScript 2.0 ever becomes a reality (please, please, please, please please!), then we'll have real classes, namespaces, and even import, include and use! Testing will become increasingly important as more organizations come to rely on growing amounts of production JavaScript code.

titleTest.Simple 0.20 Released
body±HIt gives me great pleasure, not to mention a significant amount of pride, to announce the release of Test.Simple 0.20. There are quite a few changes in this release, including a few that break backwards compatibility‚Äîbut only you're writing your own Test.Builder-based test libraries (and I don't think anyone has done so yet) or if you're subclassing Test.Harness (and there's only one of those, that I know of).

The biggest change is that Test.Harness.Browser now supports pure .js script files in addition to the original .html files. This works best in Firefox, of course, but with a lot of help from Pawel Chmielowski (prefiks on #jsan), it also works in Safari, Opera, and IE 6 (though not in XP Service Pack 2; I'll work on that after I get my new PC in the next few days). The trick with Firefox (and hopefully other browsers in the future, since it feels lest hackish to me), is that it uses the DOM to create a new HTML document in a hidden iframe, and that document loads the .js. Essentially, it just uses the DOM to mimic the structure of a typical .html test file. For the other browsers, the hidden iframe uses XMLHttpRequest to load and eval the .js test file. Check it out (verbosely)!

I think that this will greatly enhance the benefits of Test.Simple, as it makes writing tests really simple. All you have to do is create a single .html file that looks something like this:


<html>
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="./lib/JSAN.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
new JSAN("../lib").use("Test.Harness.Browser");
new Test.Harness.Browser('./lib/JSAN.js').encoding('utf-8').runTests(
    'foo.js',
    'bar.js'
);
</script>
</body>
</html>


In fact, that's pretty much exactly what Test.Simple's new harness looks like, now that I've moved all of the old tests into .js files (although there is still a simpl.html test file to ensure that .html test files still work!). Here I'm using JSAN to dynamically load the libraries I need. I use it to load Test.Harness.Browser (which then uses it to load Test.Harness), and then I tell the Test.Harness.Browser object where it is so that it can load it for each .js script. The test script itself can then look something like this:


new JSAN('../lib').use('Test.Simple');
plan({tests: 3});
ok(1, 'compile');
ok(1);
ok(1, 'foo');


And that's it! Just use JSAN to load the appropriate test library or libraries and go! I know that JSAN is already loaded because Test.Harness.Browser loads it for me before it loads and runs my .js test script. Nice, eh?

Of course, you don't have to use JSAN to run pure .js tests, although it can be convenient. Instead, you can just pass a list of files to the harness to have it load them for each test:


<html>
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="./lib/Test/Harness.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="./lib/Test/Harness/Browser.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
new Test.Harness.Browser(
    'lib/Test/Builder.js',
    'lib/Test/More.js',
    '../lib/MY/Library.js'
).runTests(
    'foo.js',
    'bar.js'
);
</script>
</body>
</html>


This example tells Test.Harness.Browser to load Test.Builder and Test.More, and then to run the tests in foo.js and bar.js. No need for JSAN if you don't want it. The test script is exactly the same as the above, only without the line with JSAN loading your test library.

Now, as I've said, this is imperfect. It's surprisingly difficult to get browsers to do this properly, and it's likely that it won't work at all in many browsers. I'm sure that I broke the Directory harness, too. Nevertheless, I'm pleased that I got as many to work as I did (again, with great thanks to Pawel Chmielowski for all the great hacks), but at this point, I'll probably only focus on adding support for Windows XP Service Pack 2. But as you might imagine, I'd welcome patches from anyone who wants to add support for other browsers.

There are a lot of other changes in this release. Here's the complete list:


  Fixed verbose test output to be complete in the harness in Safari and IE.
  Fixed plan() so that it doesn't die if the object is passed with an unknown attribute. This can happen when JS code has altered Object.prototype (shame on it!). Reported by Rob Kinyon.
  Fixed some errors in the POD documentation.
  Updated JSAN to 0.10.
  Added documentation for Test.Harness.Director, complements of Gordon McCreight.
  Fixed line endings in Konqueror and Opera and any other browser other than MSIE that supports document.all. Reported by Rob Kinyon.
  Added support to Test.Harness.Browser for .js test files in addition to .html test files. Thanks to Pawel Chmielowski for helping me to overcome the final obstacles to actually getting this feature to work.
  Added missing variable declarations. Patch from Pawel Chmielowski.
  More portable fetching of the body element in Test.Builder. Based on patch from Pawel Chmielowski.
  Added an encoding attribute to Test.Harness. This is largely to support pure JS tests, so that the browser harness can set up the proper encoding for the script elements it creates.
  Added support for Opera, with thanks to Pawel Chmielowski.
  Fixed the output from skipAll in the test harness.
  Fixed display of summary of failed tests after all tests have been run by the browser harness. They are now displayed in a nicely formatted table without a NaN stuck where it doesn't belong.
  COMPATIBILITY CHANGE: The browser harness now outputs failure information bold-faced and red. This required changing the output argument to the outputResults() method to an object with two methods, pass() and fail(). Anyone using Test.Harness.outputResults() will want to make any changes accordingly.
  COMPATIBILITY CHANGE: new Test.Builder() now always returns a new Test.Builder object instead of a singleton. If you want the singleton, call Test.Builder.instance(). Test.Builder.create() has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This is different from how Perl's Test::Builder works, but is more JavaScript-like and sensible, so we felt it was best to break things early on rather than later. Suggested by Bob Ippolito.
  Added beginAsync() and endAsync() functions to Test.More. Suggested by Bob Ippolito.

titleTestSimple 0.02 Released
bodyèZI'm pleased to announce the second alpha release of TestSimple, the port of
Test::Builder, Test::Simple, and Test::More to
JavaScript. You can download it here. This release has the following
changes:


  Removed eqArray() and eqAssoc() functions from
      TestMore per suggestion from Michael Schwern. The problem is that these
      are not test functions, and so are inconsistent with the way the rest of
      the functions work. isDeeply() is the function that users
      really want.
  Changed eqSet() to isSet() and made it into a
      real test function.
  Implemented skip(), todoSkip(),
      and todo(). These are a bit different than the Perl
      originals originals so read the docs!
  Implemented skipAll() and BAILOUT() using
      exceptions and an exception handler installed
      in window.onerror.
  The final message of a test file now properly outputs in the proper
      place. Tests must be run inside an element its id attribute set
      to test, such as <pre id="test">. The
      window.onload handler will find it and append the final test
      information.
  Implemented skipRest() in TestBuilder and TestMore. This
      method is stubbed out the Perl original, but not yet implemented
      there!


The only truly outstanding issues I see before I would consider
these modules ready for production use are:


  Figure out how to get at file names and line numbers for better
  diagnostic messages. Is this even possible in JavaScript?
  Decide where to send test output, and where to allow other output to be
  sent. Test::Builder clones STDERR and STDOUT for
  this purpose. We'll probably have to do it by overriding
  document.write()>, but it'd be good to allow users to define
  alternate outputs (tests may not always run in a browser, eh?). Maybe we can
  use an output object? Currently, a browser and its DOM are expected to be
  present. I could really use some advice from real JavaScript gurus on this
  one.
  Write tests!


Feedback/advice/insults welcome!

titleFuck Typing
bodyãychromatic's post on Perl Roles
reminded me that I've wanted for some time to blog about another kind of
composition. I call it ‚Äúfuck typing.‚Äù It's kind of
like duck typing, only not really. I would
explain, but I think that my good friend, Mr. Vinnie Goombatz, will do a much
better job. Although if you're squeamish or easily offended, you might want to
skip it.


  How you doin'? Theory aksed me to talk about fuck typing. It'd be my
  fuckin' pleasure.

  You know how sometimes you're hacking (I love that word,
  ‚Äúhacking‚Äù) some piece-a shit code, and you're using some cacasenno's
  module, but it doesn't quite do what you fuckin' want it to do?

  Here's what you say, you say, ‚ÄúOh, you don't fuckin' want to
  gimme a fuckin' prosciutto method? You got a fuckin' problem?
  'Cause you're about to have a fuckin' problem, know what I'm
  sayin'?‚Äù

  I tellya what ya gonna do. You gonna fuckin' open up that fuckin'
  paisano's module, right there, just fuckin' cut it right open, and then you
  gonna fuckin' shove the a prosciutto method right into the
  module's fuckin' guts. ‚ÄúHow do you like them apples, you fuckin'
  piece of shit?‚Äù

  And that's what you do. You fuckin' show him who's boss, know what I'm
  sayin'? If you don't get the fuckin' interface you need, you fuck the module
  up until you get it. Ain't no big fuckin' deal. Nice doin' biznizz wit'chou.


What's surprising to me is how accepted this sort of bad behavior is in
some communities. Oh, well, there are all kinds,
I guess.

titleDoomed To Reinvent
bodyòRThere's an old saying, ‚ÄúWhoever doesn't understand X is doomed to reinvent it.‚ÄùX can stand for any number of things. The other day, I was pointing out that
  such is the case for ORM developers. Take ActiveRecord, for example. As I demonstrated in a 2007 Presentation, because ActiveRecord doesn't support simple things like aggregates or querying against functions or changing how objects are identified, you have to fall back on using its find_by_sql() method to actually run the SQL, or using fuck typing to force ActiveRecord to do what you want. There are only two ways to get around this: Abandon the ORM and just use SQL, or keep improving the ORM until it has, in effect, reinvented SQL. Which would you choose?

I was thinking about this as I was hacking on a Drupal installation for a client. The design spec called for the comment form to be styled in a very specific way, with image submit buttons. Drupal has this baroque interface for building forms: essentially an array of arrays. Each element of the array is a form element, unless it's markup. Or something. I can't really make heads or tails of it. What's important is that there are a limited number of form elements you can create, and as of Drupal 5, image isn't fucking one of them!.

Now, as a software developer, I can understand this. I sometimes overlook a feature when implementing some code. But the trouble is: why have some bizarre data structure to representa subset of HTML when you have something that already works: it's called HTML.  Drupal, it seems, is doomed to reinvent HTML.

So just as I have often had to use find_by_sql() as the fallback to get ActiveRecord to fetch the data I want, as opposed to what it thinks I want, I had to fallback on the Drupal form data structure's ability to accept embedded HTML like so:


$form['submit_stuff'] = array(
  '#weight' => 20,
  '#type'   => 'markup',
  '#value'  => '<div class="form-submits">'
             . '<label></label><p class="message">(Maximum 3000 characters)</p>'
             . '<div class="btns">'
             . '<input type="image" value="Preview comment" name="op" src="preview.png" />'
             . '<img width="1" height="23" src="divider.png" />'
             . '<input type="image" value="Post comment" name="op" src="post.png" />'
             . '</div></div>',
);


Dear god, why? I understand that you can create images using an array in Drupal 6, but I fail to understand why it was ever a problem. Just give me a templating environment where I can write the fucking HTML myself. Actually, Drupal already has one, it's called PHP!. Please don't make me deal with this weird hierarchy of arrrays, it's just a bad reimplementation of a subset of HTML.

I expect that there actually is some way to get what I want, even in Drupal 5, as I'm doing some templating for comments and pages and whatnot. But that should be the default IMHO. The weird combining of code and markup into this hydra-headed data structure (and don't even get me started on the need for the #weight key to get things where I want them) is just so unnecessary.

In short, if it ain't broke, don't reinvent it!

title!Software Development Methodology
body†    I feel that it's important to have a comprehensive
    approach to software development. It's not enough to be good at coding, or
    testing, or writing documentation. It's far better to excel at managing
    every step of the development process in order to ensure the
    quality and consistency of the end-to-end work as well as of the final
    product. I aim to do just that in my work. Here I briefly outline my
    methodology for acheiving that aim.

    First, good software development starts with good planning and research.
    I strive to attain a thorough understanding of what I'm developing by
    listening to the people to whom it matters most: the users. By gaining
    insight into how people in the target market think about the problem space,
    and by strategizing about how technology can address that space, a picture
    of the product takes shape. This research coalesces into a set of pragmatic
    requirements and goals that balance the demands of a realistic development
    schedule with the needs and desires of the target market.

    Once the requirements have been identified, it's time for prototyping.
    Task flow diagrams of user interactions model the entire system. Evaluations
    from the target market refine these schematics, shaping the look and feel of
    the final product. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of seeking
    market feedback to build solid and meaningful metaphors into the design.
    These concepts drive the user experience and make or break the success of
    the final product. The outcome of this feedback loop will be a UI,
    terminology, and object design grounded on intuitive concepts, scalable
    technologies, and a reliable architecture.

    Next, a talented development team must be assembled and backed by a
    dependable, project management-oriented implementation infrastructure.
    Team-building is crucial for the success of any product, and in software
    development, a diverse set of engineers and specialists with complementary
    talents must come together and work as an efficient whole. As a result, I
    consider it extremely important to create a working culture of which team
    members want to be a part. Such an environment doesn't foster a sense of
    entitlement, but rather of conviviality and excitement. If team members
    believe in what they're doing, and they enjoy doing it, then they're likely
    to do it well.

    And what they'll do is actually create the software. Each element of the
    product design must be broken down into its basic parts, fit into a
    generalizable design, and built back up into meaningful objects. I further
    require detailed documentation of every interface and implementation, as
    well as thorough unit testing. In fact, the tests are often written before
    the interfaces are written, ensuring that they will work as expected
    throughout the remainder of the development process. All aspects of the
    application must be implemented according to a scalable, maintainable
    methodology that emphasizes consistency, quality, and efficiency.

    The emphasis on quality naturally continues into the quality assurance
    phase of the development process. The feature set is locked so that
    development engineers can work closely with QA engineers to test edge
    conditions, identify bugs, fix them, and ensure that they remain fixed. I
    prefer to have QA engineers punish nightly builds with suites of tests while
    development engineers fix the problems identified by previous days' tests.
    QA is considered complete when the product passes all the tests we can dream
    up.
    
    And finally, once all of the QA issues have been addressed, the final
    product is delivered. Naturally, the process doesn't stop there, but starts
    over -- in fact, it likely has already started over. New features must be
    schematically tested with likely users, and new interfaces designed to
    implement them. The idea is to end up with a solid product that can grow
    with the needs of the target market.

title(Adding a Git SHA1 to your Xcode Project
bodyçI found a decent Perl script for adding a Git SHA1 to an Xcode project last week. However, since by day I‚Äôm actually a Perl hacker, I couldn‚Äôt help finessing it a bit. Here are the steps to add it to your project:


Open your project settings (Project ‚Äì> Edit Project Settings) and in the ‚ÄúBuild‚Äù tab, make sure that ‚ÄúInfo.plist Output Encoding‚Äù is set to ‚Äúxml‚Äù. I lost about an hour of fiddling before I realized that my plist file was binary, which of course couldn‚Äôt really be parsed by the simple Perl script.
Edit your app‚Äôs Info.plist file. If you want the version to be the SHA1, set ‚ÄúBundle Version‚Äù to ‚Äú0x000‚Äù. I personally prefer to have a separate key for the SHA1, so I created the ‚ÄúLTGitSHA1‚Äù key and set its value to ‚Äú0x000‚Äù. This is the placeholder value that will be replaced when your app runs.
Right-click your target app and select Add ‚Äì> New Build Phase ‚Äì> New Run Script Build Phase. For the shell command, enter:

/usr/bin/env perl -wpi -0777

Paste this into the ‚ÄúScript‚Äù field:

#!/usr/bin/env perl -wpi -0777
# Xcode auto-versioning script for Subversion by Axel Andersson
# Updated for git by Marcus S. Zarra and Matt Long
# Refactored by David E. Wheeler.

BEGIN {
    @ARGV = ("$ENV{BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/$ENV{INFOPLIST_PATH}");
    ($sha1 = `git rev-parse --short HEAD`) =~ s/\s+$//;
}

s{0x000}{$sha1};

Fetch the value in your code from your bundle, something like this:

NSLog(
    @"SHA1: %@",
    [[[NSBundle mainBundle]infoDictionary]objectForKey:@"LTGitSHA1"]
);




That‚Äôs it. If you want to use a placeholder other than ‚Äú0x0000‚Äù, just change it on the last line of the script.

bodyÜ`My presentation went off well yesterday. It was in a small room, and I was delighted to find that it was standing room only. Several people told me later that they weren't able to even get into the room. I told Nat that next year he'd have to give me a keynote.

This is a new version of my usual presentation. It simplifies some things, and uses the new Bricolage Website for its example. I think that it was positively received. I've worked hard to try to make the presentation engaging, and it was nice that I didn't lose my audience; no one left during the presentation that I noticed (although it was mighty crowded in the back!). So I'm happy with it.

I exported the presentation to PDF, and added the movie that runs at the beginning as a set of slides ahead of the main presentation content. You can download the presentation from the Kineticode Website.

titleOSCON 2004 Notes
body©JI'm finally getting round to typing up my thoughts on my OSCon 2004
experience. I would've done it sooner, but I spent most of last week on
the road and fixing bugs in Bricolage.

OSCon 2004 was, in a word, great! I spent every day of the week
there, getting there around 8:30 each morning, and finally leaving the hotel
or a party each night somewhere between midnight and 3 am. I was even there
late on Sunday night, talking to folks who just came in, and late on Friday
night, at a party in Matt Sergeant's room. It was great to see so many
friends there, including Casey, Schwern Jesse, Nat, Bruce, Josh, David, Elein, Dan, Nicholas, James, Arthur, Robert, Ask
and Vani, my brother, Alex, and probably lots of other people I'm forgetting about.

There were more conversations between members of different communities than
I can recall seeing at past OSCons, and people were generally excited and
engaged. I'm told that they had the highest number of attendees since 2001.
The energy at the conference was very positive, and people seemed very
interested in things that other people were doing. Some of the highlights for
me:


  PHP on
  Parrot
  Speakers Sterling Hughes and Thies C. Arntzen talked about how amped
      they are at the idea of poring PHP to run on Parrot, the virtual machine
      being developed for Perl 6 and other dynamic languages. The session
      ended up as a conversation between Sterling and Thies, on the one hand,
      and Larry Wall and Dan Sugalski, who were sitting in the front row, on
      the other. Larry assured them that any programming language community's
      members would be first-class citizens in the Parrot world, and
      Dan told them that all they need do is ask for things they need and the
      Parrot developers would help as much as they could. Sterling wrapped up
      by saying something like, I guess the real reason we're so excited
      about Parrot is because we really love Perl! That got a good
      laugh.

  PostgreSQL
  There was a bigger PostgreSQL presence than ever at OSCon this year,
      with lots of great discussion. There seemed to be quite a few Perl folks
      going to the PostgreSQL sessions, too. Dan Sugalski was suitably
      impressed with what's coming up in PostgreSQL 8.0 (formerly 7.5) that he
      told me that he was moving up his plans for implementing pl/Parrot. A
      few of the core PostgreSQL folks said that they felt like people were
      finally being more open and exited about their use of PostgreSQL, rather
      than keeping quiet about this strategic advantage. And the
      features in 8.0 sound extremely promising, including Win32 support, save
      points/nested transactions, point-in-time recovery, tablespaces, and
      pl/Perl. It's going to be a kick-ass release, no doubt about it. Watch
      for the beta this week.

  SQLite
  SQLite is fast, ACID-compliant, relational database engine in a
      public-domain C library. It's great for embedding into an application
      because it's not a client-server application, but a simple library that
      stores databases in files. It's twice as fast as MySQL or PostgreSQL
      because it doesn't have the client/server overhead, and its extremely
      portable. Version 3.0 adds UTF-8 and UTF-16, which makes it a real
      possibility for use in Bricolage 2.0 (for small installations and demo
      servers, for example).

    I was pretty amazed at what this little database
      can do, and not only is it open-source, but because it is in the public
      domain, there are no constraints on its use. It's just one sexy
      library. Everybody run out and use it now! Perl users get it for free by
      installing DBD::SQLite from CPAN.

  Pie
  A year later, Dan lost the bet with Guido, and gave him a case of
      beer, ten bucks, and the right to put pie in his face. Dan even made two
      key-lime pies for the occasion! At the Python lightening talks, Guido
      graciously declined to pie Dan. The Pythoners seemed to think that this
      was very nice of Guido, but the Perlers in the audience (including yours
      truly), were shouting, Get him! Give him the pie! Do it, Guido!.
      As Allison commented later, it's nice how the Perl community takes
      care of its own.

    Dan later auctioned off the right for someone else to pie him in the
      face. Schwern ponied (heh) up the cash, a ca. $500 donation to
      the Perl foundation for the right, but gave it to Ponie developer
      Nicholas to enjoy. The event came off just ahead of the final keynote.
      This time Guido decided to go ahead, and he doused Dan in cream pie.
      Then Nicholas came out and gave Dan the dessert, so to speak. Great fun
      for all.

    The upshot, according to Dan, is that Guido wrote a really evil test
      suite with seven tests exercising 75% of Python's ops. Of the seven
      tests, Dan got 4 working on Parrot, and 3 of those were 2-3 times faster
      than on Python. Things look very good indeed for Parrot going forward.
      Look for the tests to be fully working on Parrot (and fast!) in the next
      few months.


There were parties and conversations every night, lots of great talk, good
food, good friends, and, well, I just had a great time. I can't wait until
next year's OSCon!

  The PostgreSQL equivalent of this presentation, in which Flickr's John Allspaw (hi John!) offers up advice on how to configure hardware, replication, and proxies for a busy MySQL-based site. Can Slony-I scale out in the same way? How does it work? I'd love to see someone who's had to make a busy PostgreSQL-based site scale up to massive load tell us how it was done.

  Something about an open-source JavaScript library project. I know that there are a number of them, each with its advantages and disadvantages. I'd love to see a successful, general repository for reusable, well-tested JavaScript libraries. Me, as a Perl guy, I'm partial to the CPAN model, which has been enormously successful. Will JSAN have similar success?


I'm sure I'll think of others in the coming weeks. What ideas do you have? Post them below!

bodyøUI‚Äôve been thinking a lot about SQL change management. I know I have
written about this before. But
I was never satisfied with that idea, mostly because it required managing
database changes in two separate but interdependent ways. Blargh. So for my
Perl projects the last couple of years, I have stuck to the very simple but
ugly Rails-style migration model, as implemented in
Module::Build::DB.

But it has been on my brain more lately because I‚Äôm writing more and more
database applications at work, and managing changes
over time is becoming increasingly annoying. I‚Äôve been using a variation on
Depesz‚Äôs Versioning
package, mainly because its idea of specifying dependencies instead of ordered
deployment scripts is so useful. However, its implementation in pure SQL, with
accompanying shell and Perl scripts, is not entirely satisfying. Worse, one
cannot easily include the contents of an earlier deployment script in a
reversion script, because the dependency registration function embedded in a
script will throw an error if it has been run before. The upshot is that if
you make a one-line change to a database function, you still have to paste the
entire thing into a new file and commit it to your source code repository.
This makes tracking diffs annoying.

Oh, and did I mention that there is no simple built-in way to revert changes,
and even if there were, because there are no named releases, it can be
difficult to decide what to revert to? I don‚Äôt often need that capability,
but when I need it, I need it.

Then, this week, Robert Haas
described a deployment implementation
he implemented. It was simple:

My last implementation worked by keeping a schema_versions table on the
server with one column, a UUID. The deployment tarball contained a file with
a list of UUIDs in it, each one associated to an SQL script. At install
time, the install script ran through that file in order and ran any scripts
whose UUID didn‚Äôt yet appear in the table, and then added the UUIDs of the
run scripts to the table.

I like this simplicity, but there are some more things I think could be done,
including dependency reslolution and reversion. And it seems silly to have a
UUID stand for a script name; why not just list script names? Better yet, tag
groups of changes for easy reference.

Yet Another SQL Deployment Strategy

So here‚Äôs my proposal. Following Robert, we create a configuration file, but
instead of just listing changes, we fill it with tags and the names of the
changes are associated with each. An example:

[alpha]
users_table

[beta]
add_widget
widgets_table

[gamma]
add_user


Our change management app will parse this file, finding the tag for each stage
of the migration in brackets, and apply the associated changes, simply finding
each of them in sql/deploy/$change.sql. If it‚Äôs reverting changes, it finds
the reversion scripts named sql/revert/$change.sql. The tags can be anything
you want; release tags might be useful. Easy so far, right?

Except notice that I have a minor ordering problem here. The add_widget
change, which adds a function to insert a record into the widgets table,
comes before the widgets_table script. If we run the add_widget change
first, it will fail, because the widgets table does not yet exist.

Of course we can re-order the lines in the configuration file. But given that
one might have many changes for a particular tag, with many cross-referenceing
dependencies, I think it‚Äôs better to overcome this problem in the scripts
themselves. So I suggest that the sql/deploy/add_widget.sql file look
something like this:

-- requires: widgets_table

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_widget(
    username   TEXT,
    widgetname TEXT
) RETURNS VOID LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
    INSERT INTO widgets (created_by, name) VALUES ($1, $2);
$$;


Here I‚Äôm stealing Depesz‚Äôs dependency tracking idea. With a simple comment at
the top of the script, we specify that this change requires that the
widgets_table change be run first. So let‚Äôs look at
sql/deploy/widgets_table.sql:

-- requires: users_table

CREATE TABLE widgets (
    created_by TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(name),
    name       TEXT NOT NULL
);


Ah, now here we also require that the users_table change be deployed first.
Of course, it likely would be, given that it appears under a tag earlier in
the file, but it‚Äôs best to be safe and explicitly spell out dependencies.
Someone might merge the two tags at some point before release, right?

The users_table change has no dependencies, but the later add_user change
of course does; our sql/deploy/add_user.sql:

-- requires: users_table

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_user(
    name TEXT
) RETURNS VOID LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
    INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ($1);
$$;


Our deployment app can properly resolve these dependencies. Of course, we also
need reversion scripts in the sql/revert directory. They might look
something like:

-- sql/revert/users_table.sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;

-- sql/revert/add_widget.sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS add_widget(text, text);

-- sql/revert/widgets_table.sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS widgets;

-- sql/revert/add_user.sql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS add_user(text);


So far so good, right? Our app can resolve dependencies in both directions, so
that if we tell it to revert to beta, it can do so in the proper order.

Now, as the deployment app runs the scripts, deploying or reverting changes,
it tracks them and their dependencies in its own metadata table in the
database, not unlike
Depesz‚Äôs Versioning
package. But because dependencies are parsed from comments in the scripts, we
are free to include the contents of one script in another. For example, say
that we later need to revise the add_widget() function to log the time a
widget is created. First we add a new script to add the necessary column:

-- requires: widgets_table
ALTER TABLE widgets ADD created_at TIMESTAMPTZ;


Call that script sql/deploy/widgets_created_at.sql. Next we add a script
that changes add_widgets():

-- requires widgets_created_at
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_widget(
    username   TEXT,
    widgetname TEXT
) RETURNS VOID LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
    INSERT INTO widgets (created_by, name, created_at)
    VALUES ($1, $2, NOW());
$$;


Call it sql/deploy/add_widget_v2.sql. Then update the deployment
configuration file with a new tag and the associated changes:

[delta]
widgets_created_at
add_widget_v2


With me so far? Now, what about reversion? sql/revert/widgets_created_at.sql
is simple, of course:

ALTER TABLE widgets DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS created_at;


But what should sql/revert/add_widget_v2.sql look like? Why, to go back to
the first version of add_widget(), it would be identical to
sql/deploy/add_widget.sql. But it would be silly to copy the whole file,
wouldn‚Äôt it? Why duplicate when we can just include?

\i sql/deploy/add_widget.sql


Boom, we get the reversion script for free. No unnecessary duplication
between deployment and reversion scripts, and all dependencies are nicely
resolved. Plus, the tags in the configuration file make it easy to deploy and
revert change sets as necessary, with dependencies properly followed.

There‚Äôs More!

To recap, I had two primary challenges with Depesz‚Äôs Versioning package to
overcome: inability to easily revert to an earlier implementation; and the
inability to easily include one script in another. Both of course are do-able
with workarounds, but I think that the addition of a deployment configuration
file with tagged sets of changes and the elimination of SQL-embedded
dependency specification overcome these issues much more effectively and
intuitively.

Still, there are two more challenges I would like to overcome:


It would be nice not to need the configuration file at all. Maintaining
such a thing can be finicky and error-prone.
I still had to duplicate the entire add_widget() function in the
add_widget_v2 script for a very simple change. This means no easy way to
simply see the diff for this change in my VCS. It would be nice not to have
to copy the entire function.



I think I have solutions for these issues, as well. More in my next post.

titleMore on Database Testing
body≥jI've been meaning for a while to come back to the topic of
database testing. After posting that entry, I
thought more about the quote from a PostgreSQL core hacker, which I think
bears repeating:


  Well, you are testing for bugs, and bugs are pretty specific in where
  they appear. Writing the tests is 90% of the job; writing the infrastructure
  is minor. If the infrastructure has limitations, which all do, you might as
  well write that extra 10% too.
  


I had been so focused on the first sentence, on the why of
database testing, that I'd not rally addressed the rest. I failed to notice
that he was questioning the utility of a testing infrastructure, or
what I would call a framework, like
pgTAP. So let me rectify
that right now by addressing his actual point.

The idea of using an established framework and
protocol
is to be able to focus exclusively on the task of writing tests, rather than
worrying about how to analyze test results. I agree that writing tests can be
time-consuming, but that doesn't mean that one should write one's own testing
framework. The great thing about pgTAP is that it emits TAP, which can then be
analyzed along with any other TAP-emitting test framework in any environment,
including
Perl,
C,
JavaScript, PHP, and even
Oracle, among others.

The other argument that might support writing one's own testing
infrastructure is if it's too hard to apply one style of testing to a given
application. For example, most of the existing
TAP
producers provide a functional interface to writing tests. SQL, on the
other hand, is not a functional language. So--leaving aside for the moment
that one can provide an effective
functional
interface for writing database tests--even if one wanted to write a
relational-style testing framework, it could still emit TAP! TAP is, after
all, just a stream of text. So as long as a SQL SELECT statement
returns a stream of TAP, then you can take advantage of the myriad of test
analysis tools out there.

Now, I was discussing the use of TAP with a different PostgreSQL
contributor, who was asking me about modifying the output of
pg_regress to be TAP. The way that pg_regress
works--and therefore how PostgreSQL core tests work--is simple: One writes SQL
statements into a test script, and then one writes an expected output file. If
the output of the tests might vary by platform, database setting, or
compile-time feature, one just creates more expected files, each with the
appropriate variations.

The PostgreSQL test runner, pg_regress then simply runs the
script through psql and diffs the output against
each expected file. If one of the files is identical to the output, the test
passes. Otherwise it fails. When the tests run, the output looks like this:


parallel group (2 tests):  copyselect copy
   copy                 ... ok
   copyselect           ... ok


My core hacker correspondent was thinking of modifying this output to be
TAP, something like this:


# Parallel group (2 tests):  copyselect copy
1..2
ok 1 - copy
ok 2 - copyselect


With this change, he could then run the regression tests through
TAP::Harness in a
cron job and send failure reports when a test failed. This is good as far as
it goes, but it has a couple of significant limitations. For one, there are no
diagnostics if something goes wrong. This is because, and this is the second
shortcoming, it just turns the result of testing a single script into TAP, not
individual assertions. There might be 1000s of SQL statements in one script,
but if the test fails, one won't know what failed until one looks at
regression.diff.

One of the great features of TAP is the support for diagnostics. For
example, if an assertion fails, you might see output something like this:


not ok 38 - The frobnitz should be named "foo"
# Failed test 38: "The frobnitz should be named "foo""
#         have: NULL
#         want: foo


Just changing the listing of the test scripts run does not get you this
advantage. That's not to say that it doesn't make certain things easier, or
that one couldn't simply have shorter test scripts in order to limit the scope
of what's being tested and what's a result. But a single test script
does not make for a good assertion. In short, pg_regress
tests don't do assertions at all. They simply compare actual and expected
output from very verbose scripts. This is a hell of a lot better than nothing,
but is still quite limited.

I suggested to my correspondent that he consider modifying the tests he was
working on to use pgTAP, instead. Of course, if you have a lot of
existing tests, it might be more trouble than it's worth to rewrite them all.
But that doesn't mean that you can't write new tests going forward using
something that's more granular, and gives you a lot more control over the
output.

His answer rather shocked me:


  I'm lucky enough to only be dealing with really good developers, so I can
  produce software that works even without focusing specifically on low-level
  unit tests.


To me, it's a misconception to think ‚Äúreally good developers‚Äù don't need
tests. As I said in reply, I consider myself a ‚Äúreally good developer,‚Äù and
I'd have a whole lot more pain with the code I maintain if it weren't for the
tests I've written. Tests do not compensate for poor coders. Rather,
they make it easier to maintain, modify, and refactor code, to fix bugs, and
to add new features. Not to mention testing my code on new versions of
software, such as testing my CPAN modules with Perl 5.10 and testing my
client's PostgreSQL databases with 8.3 or 8.4 as they look to upgrade from
8.2.

One place where my correspondent agreed that pg_regress could
use improvement is in the whole approach to matching different outputs. Using
pgTAP, one can write tests in such a way that there are different expected
results depending on database settings right in the test scripts themselves!
This is because the TAP output can vary in any number of ways, and the harness
doesn't care, as long as the tests pass. pg_regress is
extremely strict about what it considers a passing test, and this
lacks the necessary flexibility for testing some advanced features.

This is why there are no tests for multibyte character semantics (such as
locale-aware sorting) in the PostgreSQL core tests.

Are you a database testing doubter? Have I convinced you yet that a
rock-solid test suite can actually make your job easier and more enjoyable?
Perhaps I never will, but I am still very interested in your reasons for
doubting the utility of database testing. What other points should I be
thinking about as I prepare for my
PGCon presentation?

The idea that the relational model could handle only rather simple kinds of data (like numbers, and strings, and dates, and times) is a huge misconception, and always was. In fact, the term object/relational, as such, is just a piece of marketing hype ... As far as I'm concerned, an object/relational system done right would simply be a relational system done right, nothing more and nothing less.

And:

So I think it's incumbent on people not to say Tell me the business value of implementing the relational model. I think they should explain what the business value is of not implementing it. Those who ask What's the value of the relational model? are basically saying What's the value of theory? And I want them to tell me what the value is of not abiding by the theory.

title,Some Thoughts on Database Change Management
body∫SI've had reason to think about database change management lately. While I
was working on Rails apps, I of course made use
of migrations. These were an improvement over what I'd been doing
with Bricolage upgrade scripts, in the sense
that the system kept track of what version you were on (where ‚Äúversion‚Äù means
‚Äúnumeric sequence of migration scripts‚Äù) and applied whatever had a higher
number than was last applied. But Rails migrations leave a number of things to
be desired, not least of which that they support a very small subset of SQL
and require that you write the migrations in Ruby (sure I could embed SQL, and
I did, but it was still Ruby and thus not able to integrate with,
say, Slony-I).

Inspired by Rails migrations, last summer I worte some code for a customer
that did essentially the same thing, except that the migration scripts were
pure SQL scripts rather than Ruby (or Perl or whatever). I did this by
subclassing Module::Build to add a ‚Äúdb‚Äù action. So for a
deployment, you could do this:


perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build db
sudo ./Build install


And it would do the right thing, tracking which migration scripts had been
run by their numeric prefixes and updating a metadata record for each one. And
that worked great‚Ä¶except when it came to maintaining database functions and
procedures.

The problem in a nut-shell is this: Database functions are
amazingly
useful; they greatly
simplify
client interfaces and
improve
performance. But managing them in migration scripts is a recipe for
a ton of code duplication. Why? Because--unlike your Perl or Ruby
code or whatever, which you just modify in a library file and commit to your
version control system--every time you have to modify a function, you have to
paste the entire fucking thing in a new migration script and make your changes
there.

Try to imagine, for a moment, what that means for a function such as the
recurring_events_for() function in my piece
on generating
recurring events in the database. Say there was a bug in the function,
where it was failing to return some instances of events that fall between the
recurrence dates. A simple patch might look something like this:


@@ -22,7 +22,10 @@
                   recurrence <> 'none'
               OR  (
                      recurrence = 'none'
-                 AND starts_at BETWEEN range_start AND range_end
+                 AND (
+                         starts_at BETWEEN range_start AND range_end
+                      OR ends_at   BETWEEN range_start AND range_end
+                 )
               )
           )
     LOOP


Pretty straight-forward, right? But not for migration scripts!. To
make this three-line change with migrations, I'd actually have to paste the
entire 58-line function into a new migration script, make the changes and then
commit. There are at least two problems with this approach: 1) A huge amount
of code duplication for no good reason; and 2) No real change management!
Someone looking at
SVN::Notify notifications would not easily be
able to see what changed, because the diff does not show what lines changed in
the funcion, only that a whole new file with a whole new function was added.
Yikes!

And it can get worse than this. For a client I'm currently working with,
the state of the production database is tracked in Subversion by running a
nightly cron job that dumps the database schema to a file and
checks it into subversion. Mirgration scripts are written in pure SQL and
named with bug numbers, but once they are pushed to production,
the bloody migration scripts are deleted because the nightly schema dump
reflets the changes!. So, for function updates, the are committed to
Subversion en masse twice!

So I'd like to propose a different approach to database change management.
Or, rather, a more diversified approach.

First, you can have numbered migration scripts. This works very well for
simple schema changes, like adding a table, column, foreign key, or index,
because the SQL statements that get committed in the scripts describe exactly
what they're doing. ALTER statments are uncomplicated, and show
only what they're altering. You can also easily write downgrade migration
scripts to use in case something goes wrong, just by using the same script
number in a different directory. So you'd have somehting like this:


sql/
sql/migrations/
sql/migrations/up/
sql/migrations/up/001-create_user_table.sql
sql/migrations/up/002-add_fk_for_user.sql
sql/migrations/down/
sql/migrations/down/001-drop_user_table.sql
sql/migrations/down/002-drop_fk_for_user.sql


That's the first part, not unlike how Rails migrations work or the stuff I
wrote for a client last year. But then there's a second set of migration
scripts. These are managed like Perl or Ruby libraries or what-have-you, such
that you can just add and/or change files as necessary. It might look like
this, with one database function or procedure per file:


sql/migrations/lib/
sql/migrations/lib/generate_recurrences.sql
sql/migrations/lib/recurring_events_for.sql


Each of these files has one function defined using CREATE OR REPLACE
FUNCTION. This means that they can be run over and over again without
problem. If I run into a bug in my recurring_events_for()
function, I just change it in recurring_events_for.sql, commit
it, and I'm done.

The code that handles the database build can then track both the migration
number and the timestamp for the last commit migrated in the
sql/migrations/lib directory. Once the numbered migrations are
run, it can then decide what lib migrations to run by looking for
those that have been modified since the last time migrations were run. In
Perl, using Git, that'd be something like this:


sub run {
    my $cmd = shift;
    map { s/^\s+//; s/\s+$//; $_ } `$cmd`;
}

my $lib = 'lib';
my $date = '2009-04-01 00:01:00';
my ($rev) = run "git rev-list --reverse --since='$date' master -- '$lib'";

for my $script (
    map  { $_->[0] }
    sort { $a->[1] cmp $b->[1] }
    map  { chomp; [ $_ => run "git log -1 --pretty=format:%ci '$_'" ]  }
    run "git diff --name-only $rev^ '$lib'"
) {
    system qw(psql -f), $script;
}


First, we get the oldest revision SHA1 ID since the specified date and
store it in $rev. The magic is in the for loop
which, due to the antiquity of Perl list functions, you must read
bottom-to-top (aside: this can be rectified
by autoboxing). We use git diff --name-only to get a list
of all the files changed in the directory since just before that revision. For
file each, we get the date of the most recent commit, sort on the date, and
then apply the migration by passing it to psql -f.

In reality, the code should also update the metadata table in the database
with the date of each script as it's applied -- but only if it succeeds. If it
fails, we just die. If you needed to migrate down, the code could just check
out the files as they were at $rev^ and apply them. Yeah, use
the change management interface to go back in time: who'da thought it?

Anyway, that's the idea. I think I'll implement this for an internal app
I've been hacking on and off, just to see what kinds of issues might come up.
Anyone else thought of something like this? Maybe there's something already
out there? I'm not interested in automatic migrations
like DBIx::Class Schema migrations,
as I don't rely on ORMs anymore (probably should blog that one of these days,
too). I'm just curious what other approaches folks have taken to database
change management. Let me know.

title*What Name Do You Use for an Order Column?
bodyálQuick poll.

Say that you have a join table mapping blog entries to tags, and you want the tags to be ordered for each entry. The table might look something like this:


CREATE TABLE entry_join_tag (
  entry_id integer REFERENCES entry(id)
                   ON UPDATE CASCADE
                   ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tag_id   integer REFERENCES tag(id)
                   ON UPDATE CASCADE
                   ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ord       smallint,
  PRIMARY KEY (entry_id, tag_id)
);


It's the ord column I'm talking about here, wherein to order tags for each blog entry, you'd do a select like this:


SELECT entry_id, tag_id
FROM   entry_join_tag
ORDER BY entry_id, ord;


So my question is this: What name do you typically give to the ordering column, since order itself isn't available in SQL (it's a reserved word, of course). Some of the options I can think of:


  ord
  ordr
  seq
  place
  rank
  tag_ord
  tag_order
  tag_place
  tag_rank
  tag_seq


Leave a comment to let me know. Thanks!

title+Learn Mad Database Skillz at YAPC::NA 2009
bodyû A few weeks ago, I
twittered that, in
my opinion, application developers should really learn how to use databases.
And by that I mean SQL, really. I know that a lot of app developers like to
use ORMs to access the
database, so that you don't have to really think about it, but most ORMs are
written by people who don't like databases, don't
like SQL, haven't taken the time to learn it in any depth, and thus don't
write very good SQL. And even if they do
like SQL, that usually means they provide a way for you to execute SQL
queries directly. The reason? Because the ORM does not really understand how
building more and more complex queries can have negative performance issues,
and that
there
is more than one way to do it. It's pretty common to have to go back to
custom SQL to solve performance issues. So to solve those problems, you gotta
understand SQL.

Another sin of application developers is to try to use very standard SQL 
syntax and features when writing SQL queries, so that they can easily be
ported to other databases. Well, if you're going to do that, you might as well
use an ORM, but never mind. Think about it this way: If you were writing an
application in Ruby, would you avoid the
use of blocks because you might someday
want to port it to Perl? And how often have you decided to port an application
to another database, anyway? Sure, some OSS projects add support for new
databases, but they seldom drop support for one RDBMS in favor of another.

If you're writing an application in
Perl, it pays to learn
idiomatic Perl. If you're
writing it in Ruby, it pays to use
idiomatic Ruby. So
why would you settle for anything less when using an RDBMS? SQL is, after all,
just another programming language, and the various dialects have their
advantages and disadvantages. Learning how SQL really works and how to
leverage the features of your RDBMS will only improve the performance,
reliability, and scalability of your app. If your Perl or Ruby or Python code
doesn't look like C, why would you write least-common denominator ANSI-92
compliant SQL? You have a powerful programming language and application server
with an amazing array of features and capabilities. Use them!

All of which is a very long-winded way to say that it really, truly
pays to learn the ins and outs of SQL, just like any other language. And if
you're a Perl hacker, you have a great opportunity to do just that at
YAPC::NA 10 this summer.
In reponse to my tweet, YAPC organizer Robert Blackwell
replied in
agreement, and pointed out that famed SQL expert
Joe Celko, author of
numerous volumes on SQL syntax and
techniques, will be offering two classes on SQL at YAPC:


  Introduction to RDBMS and
  SQL for the Totally Ignorant. Well, okay, the name of the course is a
  bit unfortunate, but the material covered is not. If you know little or
  nothing about SQL, this course should be a terrific introduction.
  The New Stuff in SQL You
  Don't Know About. So much great stuff has been added to SQL over the
  years, and ORMs know virtually none of it. Learn how to put that stuff to
  work in your apps!


This is a great opportunity to expand your knowledge of SQL, how it works,
and why it's so powerful. (Even if you're not fond of the idea of relational
databases, think of it as an opportunity to follow
Tom Christiansen's injunction and
learn a bit about logical programming.) Celko knows SQL like nobody's
business, and will be sharing that knowledge in two remarkably cheap courses.
Even if you're not a Perl hacker, if you want to really learn the ins and outs
of SQL-- how to write idiomatic SQL to match the mad skillz you already apply
to your application code, you could hardly do better than to get in on these
deals and drink from the Celko firehose. I only wish I was going to be there
(alas, prior plans interfered). But do please tell me all about it!

body–In my previous post,
I outlined the basics of a configuration-file and dependency-tracking SQL
deployment architecture, but left a couple of additional challenges
unresolved. They were:


I would rather not have to hand-edit a configuration file, as it it‚Äôs
finicky and error-prone.
There is still more duplication of code than I would like, in that a
procedure defined in one change script would have to be copied whole
to a new script for any changes, even single-line simple changes.



I believe I can solve both of these issues by simple use of a VCS. Since all
of my current projects currently use Git, I will use it for the examples here.

Git it On

First, recall the structure of the configuration file, which was something
like this:

[alpha]
users_table

[beta]
add_widget
widgets_table

[gamma]
add_user

[delta]
widgets_created_at
add_widget_v2


Basically, we have bracketed tags identifying changes that should be deployed.
Now have a look at this:

> git log -p --format='[%H]' --name-only --reverse sql/deploy
[8920aaf7947a56f6777e69a21b70fd877c8fd6dc]

sql/deploy/users_table.sql
[f7da5fd4b7391747f75d85db6fa82de47b9e4c00]

sql/deploy/add_widget.sql
sql/deploy/widgets_table.sql
[ea10b9e566934ef256debe8752504189436e162a]

sql/deploy/add_user.sql

sql/deploy/add_widget_v2.sql
sql/deploy/widgets_created_at.sql


Look familiar? Let‚Äôs use a bit of awk magic to neaten things a bit (Thanks
helwig!):

> git log -p --format='[%H]' --name-only --reverse sql/deploy \
| awk '/^\[/ {print ""} /./'

[8920aaf7947a56f6777e69a21b70fd877c8fd6dc]
sql/deploy/users_table.sql

sql/deploy/add_widget_v2.sql
sql/deploy/widgets_created_at.sql


Ah, that‚Äôs better. We have commit SHA1s for tags, followed by the appropriate
lists of deployment scripts. But wait, we can decorate it, too:

> git log -p --format='[%H%d]' --name-only --reverse sql/deploy \
| awk '/^\[/ {print ""} /./'

[8920aaf7947a56f6777e69a21b70fd877c8fd6dc (alpha)]

sql/deploy/add_user.sql
[89e85f98d891a2984ad4e3c42d8ca8cf31f3b2b4 (HEAD, delta, master)]


Look at that! Actual VCS tags built right in to the output. So, assuming our
deployment app can parse this output, we can deploy or revert to any commit or
tag. Better yet, we don‚Äôt have to maintain a configuration file, because the
VCS is already tracking all that stuff for us! Our change management app can
automatically detect if we‚Äôre in a Git repository (or Mercurial or CVS or
Subversion or whatever) and fetch the necessary information for us. It‚Äôs all
there in the history. We can name revision identifiers (SHA1s here) to deploy
or revert to, or use tags (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, HEAD, or master in this
example).

And with careful repository maintenance, this approach will work for branches,
as well. For example, say you have developers working in two branches,
feature_foo and feature_bar. In feature_foo, a foo_table change script
gets added in one commit, and an add_foo script in a second commit. Merge it
into master and the history now looks like this:

> git log -p --format='[%H%d]' --name-only --reverse sql/deploy \
| awk '/^\[/ {print ""} /./'

[8920aaf7947a56f6777e69a21b70fd877c8fd6dc (alpha)]

sql/deploy/add_foo.sql


So far so good.

Meanwhile, development in the feature_bar branch has added a bar_table
change script in one commit and add_bar in another. Because development in
this branch was going on concurrently with the feature_foo branch, if we
just merged it into master, we might get a history like this:

> git log -p --format='[%H%d]' --name-only --reverse sql/deploy \
| awk '/^\[/ {print ""} /./'

sql/deploy/add_bar.sql

[73979ede2c8589cfe24c9213a9538f305e6f508f (HEAD, master, feature_foo)]


Note that bar_table comes before add_foo. In other words, the
feature_foo and feature_bar commits are interleaved. If we were to deploy
to HEAD, and then need to revert feature_bar, bar_table would not be
reverted. This is, shall we say, less than desirable.

There are at least two ways to avoid this issue. One is to squash the merge
into a single commit using git merge --squash feature_bar. This would be
similar to accepting a single patch and applying it. The resulting history
would look like this:

> git log -p --format='[%H%d]' --name-only --reverse sql/deploy \
| awk '/^\[/ {print ""} /./'

[8920aaf7947a56f6777e69a21b70fd877c8fd6dc (alpha)]

sql/deploy/add_bar.sql
sql/deploy/bar_table.sql


Now both of the feature_bar change scripts come after the feature_foo
changes. But it might be nice to keep the history. So a better solution (and
the best practice, I believe), is to rebase the feature_bar branch before
merging it into master, like so:

> git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: Add bar.
Applying: Add add_bar().
> git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
> git merge feature_bar
Updating 7f89e23..0fab7a0

Awesome, now everything is in the correct order. We did lose the feature_foo
‚Äútag,‚Äù though. That‚Äôs because it wasn‚Äôt a tag, and neither is feature_bar
here. They are, rather, branch names, which we becomes obvious when using
‚Äúfull‚Äù decoration:

git log --format='%d' --decorate=full HEAD^..      
 (HEAD, refs/heads/master, refs/heads/feature_foo)


After the next commit, it will disappear from the history. So let‚Äôs just tag the

Ah, there we go! After the next commit, one of those feature_bars will
disappear, since the branch will have been left behind. But we‚Äôll still have
the tag.

Not Dead Yet

Clearly we can intelligently use Git to manage SQL change management. (Kind of
stands to reason, doesn‚Äôt it?) Nevertheless, I believe that a configuration
file still might have its uses. Not only because not every project is in a VCS
(it ought to be!), but because oftentimes a project is not deployed to
production as a git clone. It might be distributed as a source tarball or an
RPM. In such a case, including a configuration file in the distribution would
be very useful. But there is still no need to manage it by hand; our
deployment app can generate it from the VCS history before packaging for
release.

More to Come

I‚Äôd planned to cover the elimination of duplication, but I think this is
enough for one post. Watch for that idea in my next post.

bodyﬂ]In the previous episode
in this series, I had one more issue with regard to SQL change management that
I wanted to resolve:


There is still more duplication of code than I would like, in that a
procedure defined in one change script would have to be copied whole
to a new script for any changes, even simple single-line changes.



So let‚Äôs see what we can do about that. Loading it into Git, our
first example looks
like this:

> alias sqlhist="git log -p --format='[%H%d]' --name-only --reverse sql/deploy \
| awk '/^\[/ {print \"\"} /./'"

[b8b9f5c152675305c6b2d3e105d55a25019e0828 (HEAD, gamma, master)]
sql/deploy/add_user.sql


(Aside: I‚Äôve created an alias, sqlhist, on the first line, so that all the Git
and Awk magic doesn‚Äôt clutter the remaining examples.)

So, we‚Äôve got the creation of the users table under the alpha tag, the
addition of the widgets table and an accompanying add_widget() function
under the beta tag, and the creation of the add_user() function under the
gamma tag. So far so good. Now, let‚Äôs say that gamma has been deployed to
production, and now we‚Äôre ready to add a feature for the next release.

Modify This

It turns out that our users really want a timestamp for the time a widget was
created. So let‚Äôs add a new change script that adds a created_at column to
the widgets table. First we add sql/deploy/widgets_created_at.sql with:

-- requires: widgets_table
ALTER TABLE widgets ADD created_at TIMESTAMPTZ;


And then the accompanying revert script, sql/revert/widgets_created_at.sql:

ALTER TABLE widgets DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS created_at;


Commit them and now our deployment configuration looks like this:

> sqlhist

[3852b378aa029cc610a03806e8268ed452dce8a6 (alpha)]

[44ba615b7813531f0acb6810cbf679791fe57bf2 (HEAD, master)]
sql/deploy/widgets_created_at.sql


So far so good. We have a simple delta script that modifies the existing
table, and there is no code duplication. Time to modify the add_widget()
function to insert the timestamp. Recall that, in the
first article in
this series, I created a separate sql/deploy/add_widgets_v2.sql file, copied
the existing function in its entirety into the new file, and modified it
there. If we were to do that here, the resulting deployment configuration
would look something like this:

> sqlhist

Which would be fine, except that if someone else wanted to see what had
changed, here‚Äôs what git diff would output:

> git diff HEAD^ sql/deploy

So, what changed in the add_widget() function between gamma and now? One
cannot tell from this diff: it looks like a brand new function. And no
web-based VCS interface will show you, either; it‚Äôs just not inherent in the
commit. We have to actually know that it was just an update to an existing

 $$;


Much better, but how annoying is that? It doesn‚Äôt allow us to really take
advantage of the VCS, all because we need SQL changes to run in a very
specific order.

But let‚Äôs ignore that for the moment. Let‚Äôs just throw out the commit with
add_widgets_v2.sql and go ahead and change the add_widget change script
directly. So the history now looks like this:

> sqlhist

[3852b378aa029cc610a03806e8268ed452dce8a6 (alpha)]

[e4b970aa36f27451fe377791eab040a73c6eb47a (HEAD, epsilon, master)]
sql/deploy/add_widget.sql


Naturally, the add_widget script appears twice now, once under the beta
tag and once under epsilon (which I‚Äôve just tagged). What are the
consequences for our migration? Well, if we were to build a new database from
the beginning, running these migrations as listed here, we would get an error
while applying the beta changes:

ERROR:  column "created_at" of relation "widgets" does not exist
LINE 5:     INSERT INTO widgets (created_by, name, created_at)


This is because the created_at column won‚Äôt exist until the
widgets_created_at change is applied. That won‚Äôt do, will it? Fortunately,
Git knows exactly what the add_widget deploy script looked like under the
beta tag, and we can ask it:

> git show beta:sql/deploy/add_widget.sql
-- requires: widgets_table

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_widget(
    username   TEXT,
    widgetname TEXT
) RETURNS VOID LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
    INSERT INTO widgets (created_by, name) VALUES ($1, $2);
$$;


Boom, there it is, with no reference to created_at. Using this technique,
our SQL deployment app can successfully apply all of our database changes by
iterating over the list of changes and applying the contents of each script
at the time of the appropriate commit or tag. In other words, it could apply
the output from each of these commands:

git show alpha:sql/deploy/users_table.sql
git show beta:sql/deploy/widgets_table.sql
git show beta:sql/deploy/add_widget.sql
git show gamma:sql/deploy/add_user.sql
git show 44ba615b7813531f0acb6810cbf679791fe57bf2:sql/deploy/widget_created_at.sql
git show epsilon:sql/deploy/add_widget.sql


And everything will work exactly as it should: the original version of the
add_widget change script will be for the beta tag, and the next version
will be applied for the epsilon tag. Not bad, right? We get a nice, clean
Git history and can exploit it to manage the changes.

Reversion to the Mean

But what about reversion? What if the deploy to epsilon failed, and we need
to revert back to gamma? Recall that in the
first article, I
eliminated duplication by having the add_widget_v2 revert script simply
call the add_widget deploy script. But such is not possible now that we‚Äôve
changed add_widget in place. What to do?

The key is for the change management script to know the difference between a
new change script and a modified one. Fortunately, Git knows that, too, and we
can get it to cough up that information with a simple change to the sqlhist
alias: instead of passing --name-only, pass --name-status:

% alias sqlhist="git log -p --format='[%H%d]' --name-status --reverse sql/deploy \
| awk '/^\[/ {print \"\"} /./'"


Using this new alias, our history looks like:

> sqlhist

[3852b378aa029cc610a03806e8268ed452dce8a6 (alpha)]
A   sql/deploy/users_table.sql

[e4b970aa36f27451fe377791eab040a73c6eb47a (HEAD, epsilon, master)]
M   sql/deploy/add_widget.sql


Now we have a letter defining the status of each file. An ‚ÄúA‚Äù means the file
was added in that commit; an ‚ÄúM‚Äù means it was modified. But the upshot is
that, to revert to gamma, our change management can see that add_widget
was modified in epsilon, and, rather than apply a revert change script, it
can just apply the version of the script as it existed under gamma:

> git show gamma:sql/deploy/add_widget.sql
-- requires: widgets_table

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_widget(
    username   TEXT,
    widgetname TEXT
) RETURNS VOID LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
    INSERT INTO widgets (created_by, name) VALUES ($1, $2);
$$;


And there we are, right back to where we should be. Of course, the remaining
epsilon deploy script, widget_created_at, was added in its commit, so we
just apply the revert script and we‚Äôre set, back to gamma.

Still Configurable

To get back to the original idea of a migration configuration file, I still
think it‚Äôs entirely do-able. All we need to is to have the change management
app generate it, just as before.
When it comes to modified ‚Äî rather than added ‚Äî deploy scripts, it can
automatically insert new scripts with the full copies of previous versions,
much as before. The resulting configuration would look something like this:

[3852b378aa029cc610a03806e8268ed452dce8a6 (alpha)]
sql/deploy/users_table.sql

[32883d5a08691351b07928fa4e4fb7e68c500973 (beta)]

[b8b9f5c152675305c6b2d3e105d55a25019e0828 (gamma)]
sql/deploy/add_user.sql

[44ba615b7813531f0acb6810cbf679791fe57bf2]
sql/deploy/widgets_created_at.sql

[e4b970aa36f27451fe377791eab040a73c6eb47a (HEAD, epsilon, master)]
sql/deploy/add_widget_v2.sql


Note that last line, where we now have add_widget_v2. The change management
script would simply generate this file, and create an additional revert script
with the same name that just contains the contents of the deploy script as it
was under the gamma tag.

Too Baroque?

Having written down these ideas that have plagued by brain for the last week,
along with some examples using Git to confirm them, I‚Äôm convinced more than
ever that this is entirely workable. But it also leads me to wonder if it‚Äôs
too baroque. I intend these posts as a rough spec for how this thing should
work, and I plan to implement it in the coming weeks. But I‚Äôm wondering how
difficult it will be to explain it all to people?

So let me see if I can break it down to a few simple rules.


In general, you should create independent deploy and revert scripts for your
SQL. Put a CREATE TABLE statement into its own script. If it requires some
some other table, require declare the dependency. If you need to change it
later, create a new script that uses ALTER TABLE.
In special cases where a simple change cannot be made without copying
something wholesale, and where the deploy script is idempotent, you may
simply modify the deploy script in-place.



That‚Äôs about it. The idempotence
of the deploy script is important for ensuring consistency, and applies very
well to features such as
user-defined functions.
For other objects, there are generally ALTER statements that allow changes
to be made without wholesale copying of existing code.

So what am I missing? What have I overlooked? What mistakes in my logic have I
made? Do you think this will be too tricky to implement, or to use? Is it hard
to understand? Your comments would be greatly appreciated, because I am
going to write an app to do this stuff, and want to get it right.

Thanks for sticking with me through all the thought experiments. For my next
post on this topic, I expect to have an interface spec for the new app.

bodyÑ~So, what advanced SQL book should I buy? I've learned a lot about SQL over the last year or so, but I'm sure that Josh Berkus is tired of being my own personal advanced SQL reference. So I'd like to really learn more about triggers, stored procedures, rules, views, and whatnot, what they're best used for and when to use them. And other typical database features that I'm not familiar with, of course.

What I don't need is an introduction to SQL. There are a million of those, and they all have much the same stuff. I want to really get into advanced concepts.

So what's the best choice? Leave me a comment with your opinion. Thanks!

title-SQL Hack: The Something-est From Each Entity
body∑vThis is a pattern that I have dealt with many times, but never figured out how to adequately handle. Say that you have imported a mailbox into your database, and you want a list of the latest messages between each pair of recipients (sender and receiver ‚Äî I'm ignoring multiple receivers for the moment). The data might look like this:


BEGIN;

CREATE TABLE messages (
   sender   TEXT        NOT NULL,
   receiver TEXT        NOT NULL,
   sent_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT clock_timestamp(),
   body     TEXT        NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);

INSERT INTO messages ( sender, receiver, body )
VALUES ('Theory', 'Strongrrl', 'Hi There.' );

INSERT INTO messages ( sender, receiver, body )
VALUES ('Strongrrl', 'Theory', 'Hi yourself.' );

INSERT INTO messages ( sender, receiver, body )
VALUES ('Anna', 'Theory', 'What''s for dinner?' );

INSERT INTO messages ( sender, receiver, body )
VALUES ('Theory', 'Anna', 'Brussels Sprouts.' );

INSERT INTO messages ( sender, receiver, body )
VALUES ('Anna', 'Theory', 'Oh man!' );

COMMIT;


So the goal is to show the most recent message between Theory and Strongrrl and the most recent message between Theory and Anna, without regard to who is the sender and who is the receiver. After running into this many times, today I consulted my colleagues, showing them this dead simple (and wrong!) query to demonstrate what I wanted:


SELECT sender, recipient, sent_at, body
  FROM messages
 GROUP BY sender, recipient
HAVING sent_at = max(sent_at);


That‚Äôs wrong because one can‚Äôt have columns in the SELECT expression that are not either aggregate expressions or included in theGROUP BY expression. It‚Äôs a violation of the standard (and prone to errors, I suspect). Andrew immediately said, ‚ÄúClassic case for DISTINCT ON‚Äù. This lovely little expression is a PostgreSQL extension not included in the SQL standard. It‚Äôs implementation looks like this:


SELECT DISTINCT ON (
          CASE WHEN receiver > sender
              THEN receiver || sender
              ELSE sender   || receiver
          END
       ) sender, receiver, sent_at, body
  FROM messages
 ORDER BY CASE WHEN receiver > sender
              THEN receiver || sender
              ELSE sender   || receiver
          END, sent_at DESC;


This query is saying, ‚Äúfetch the rows where the sender and the receiver are distinct, and order by sent_at DESC. THE CASE statement to get a uniform value for the combination of sender and receiver is a bit unfortunate, but it does the trick:


  sender   | receiver |            sent_at            |     body     
-----------+----------+-------------------------------+--------------
 Anna      | Theory   | 2010-01-12 05:00:07.026711+00 | Oh man!
 Strongrrl | Theory   | 2010-01-12 05:00:07.02589+00  | Hi yourself.


Great, exactly the data I wanted. And the CASE statement can actually be indexed to speed up filtering. But I wondered if it would be possible to get the same results without the DISTINCT ON. In other words, can this be done with standard SQL? If you're using PostgreSQL 8.4, the answer is ‚Äúyes.‚Äù All you have to do is exploit window functions and a subquery. It looks like this:


SELECT sender, receiver, sent_at, body
  FROM (
    SELECT sender, receiver, sent_at, body,
           row_number() OVER ( PARTITION BY 
               CASE WHEN receiver > sender
                   THEN receiver || sender
                   ELSE sender   || receiver
               END
               ORDER BY sent_at DESC
           ) AS rnum
      FROM messages
  ) AS t
 WHERE rnum = 1;


Same nasty CASE statement as before (no way around it with this database design, alas), but this is fully conforming SQL. It‚Äôs also the first time I've ever used window functions. If you just focus on the row_number() OVER () expression, it‚Äôs simply partitioning the table according to the same value as in the DISTINCT ON value, but it‚Äôs ordering it by sent_at directly. The result is a row number, where the first is 1 for the most recent message for each combination of recipients. Then we just filter for that in the WHERE clause.

Not exactly intuitive (I'm really only understanding it now as I explain write it out), but quite straight-forward once you accept the expressivity in this particular OVER expression. It might be easier to understand if we remove some of the cruft. If instead we wanted the most recent message from each sender (regardless of the recipient), we'd write:


SELECT sender, receiver, sent_at, body
  FROM (
    SELECT sender, receiver, sent_at, body,
           row_number() OVER (
               PARTITION BY sender ORDER BY sent_at DESC
           ) AS rnum
      FROM messages
  ) AS t
 WHERE rnum = 1;


And that yields:


  sender   | receiver |            sent_at            |     body     
-----------+----------+-------------------------------+--------------
 Anna      | Theory   | 2010-01-12 05:00:07.026711+00 | Oh man!
 Strongrrl | Theory   | 2010-01-12 05:00:07.02589+00  | Hi yourself.
 Theory    | Anna     | 2010-01-12 05:00:07.24982+00  | Brussels Sprouts.


Furthermore, we can use a common table expression to eliminate the subquery. This query is functionally identical to the subquery example (returning to uniqueness for sender and receiver), just with the WITH clause coming before the SELECT clause, setting things up for it:


WITH t AS (
    SELECT sender, receiver, sent_at, body,
           row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY CASE
               WHEN receiver > sender
                   THEN receiver || sender
                   ELSE sender   || receiver
                   END
               ORDER BY sent_at DESC
           ) AS rnum
      FROM messages
) SELECT sender, receiver, sent_at, body
    FROM t
   WHERE rnum = 1;


So it‚Äôs kind of like putting the subquery first, only it‚Äôs not a subquery, it‚Äôs more like a temporary view. Nice, eh? Either way, the results are the same as before:


  sender   | receiver |            sent_at            |     body     
-----------+----------+-------------------------------+--------------
 Anna      | Theory   | 2010-01-12 05:00:07.026711+00 | Oh man!
 Strongrrl | Theory   | 2010-01-12 05:00:07.02589+00  | Hi yourself.


I hereby dub this ‚ÄúThe Entity‚Äôs Something-est‚Äù pattern (I'm certain someone else has already come up with a good name for it, but this will do). I can see it working any place requiring the highest, lowest, latest, earliest, or something else-est item from each of a list of entities. Perhaps the latest headline from every news source:


WITH t AS (
    SELECT source, headline, dateline, row_number() OVER (
               PARTITION BY source ORDER BY dateline DESC
           ) AS rnum
      FROM news
) SELECT source, headline, dateline
    FROM t
   WHERE rnum = 1;


Or perhaps the lowest score for for each basketball team over the course of a season:


WITH t AS (
    SELECT team, date, score, row_number() OVER (
               PARTITION BY team ORDER BY score
           ) AS rnum
      FROM games
) SELECT team, date, score
    FROM t
   WHERE rnum = 1;


Easy! How have you handled a situation like this in your database hacking?

titleDynamic OFFSETs and LIMITs
bodyïlI discovered a great hack for dealing with optional offsets and limits in PostgreSQL functions while working for a client, and I wanted to get it down here so that I wouldn't forget it.

The deal is that I was writing tests for functions that returned a set of IDs for objects based on some criterion plus an optional offset and limit. The functions looked something like this:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_widgets_for_user_id(
    a_user_id integer,
    a_offset  integer,
    a_limit   integer
) RETURNS SETOF integer AS $$ 
DECLARE  
    l_id    integer;
    l_query text;
BEGIN
    v_query := 'SELECT id FROM widgets WHERE user_id = ' || a_user_id
            || ' ORDER BY created_at DESC';
    IF a_offset IS NOT NULL THEN 
        l_query := l_query || ' OFFSET ' || a_offset; 
    END IF; 
    IF a_limit IS NOT NULL THEN 
        l_query := l_query || ' LIMIT ' || a_limit; 
    END IF; 

    FOR l_id IN EXECUTE l_query LOOP 
          RETURN NEXT l_id;
    END LOOP; 
     
    RETURN; 
END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;


It seemed silly to me that this should be in PL/pgSQL: ultimately, it's such a simple query that I wanted it to be a SQL query. Of course I knew that if a_offset was NULL I could fallback on 0. But what about dealing with a NULL limit?

Well, it turns out that you can pass a CASE statement to the LIMIT clause that optionally returns no value at all and it will just work. Observe:


try=% select id from widgets LIMIT CASE WHEN false THEN 3 END;
 id
----
   1
   2
   3
   4
(4 rows)


Pretty weird, huh? Well, for my purposes, it's perfect, because I was able to rewrite that function as a pure SQL function, and it's a lot simpler, to boot:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_widgets_for_user_id(
    a_user_id integer,
    a_offset  integer,
    a_limit   integer
) RETURNS SETOF integer AS $$ 
    SELECT id
      FROM widgets
     WHERE user_id = $1
     ORDER BY created_at DESC
    OFFSET COALESCE( $2, 0 )
     LIMIT CASE WHEN $3 IS NOT NULL THEN $3 END
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;


Now isn't that a hell of a lot easier to read? Like I said, it's a little weird, but overall I think it's a pretty good hack. I've tested it with PostgreSQL 8.2 and 8.3. Not sure about other versions, but give it a try!

Update: Thanks for the comments! With the insight that CASE is ultimately passing a NULL to LIMIT when the value is NULL, I realised that I could switch from CASE to COALESCE for nice parity with the handling of the OFFSET clause. Check it out:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_widgets_for_user_id(
    a_user_id integer,
    a_offset  integer,
    a_limit   integer
) RETURNS SETOF integer AS $$ 
    SELECT id
      FROM widgets
     WHERE user_id = $1
     ORDER BY created_at DESC
    OFFSET COALESCE( $2, 0 )
     LIMIT COALESCE( $3, NULL )
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

title'Managing Key/Value Pairs in PostgreSQL
body¬Let's say that you've been following the latest research in key/value data storage and are interested in managing such data in a PostgreSQL database. You want to have functions to store and retrieve pairs, but there is no natural way to represent pairs in SQL. Many languages have hashes or or data dictionaries to fulfill this role, and you can pass them to functional interfaces. SQL's got nothin‚Äô. In PostgreSQL, have two options: use nested arrays (simple, fast) or use a custom composite data type (sugary, legible).

Let's assume you have this table for storing your pairs:


CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE kvstore (
    key        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    value      TEXT,
    expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() + '12 hours'::interval
);


To store pairs, you can use nested arrays like so:


SELECT store(ARRAY[ ['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 'yow'] ]);


Not too bad, and since SQL arrays are a core feature of PostgreSQL, there's nothing special to do. Here's the store() function:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION store(
    params text[][]
) RETURNS VOID LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1 .. array_upper(params, 1) LOOP
        UPDATE kvstore
           SET value      = params[i][2],
               expires_at = NOW() + '12 hours'::interval
         WHERE key        = param[i][1];
        CONTINUE WHEN FOUND;
        INSERT INTO kvstore (key, value)
        VALUES (params[i][1], params[i][2]);
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;


I've seen worse. The trick is to iterate over each nested array, try an update for each, and insert when no row is updated. Alas, you have no control over how many elements a user might include in a nested array. One might call it as:


SELECT store(ARRAY[ ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'] ]);


Or:


SELECT store(ARRAY[ ['foo'] ]);


No errors will be thrown in either case. In the first the "baz" will be ignored, and in the second the value will default to NULL. If you really didn't like these behaviors, you could add some code to throw an exception if array_upper(params, 2) returns anything other than 2.

Let's look at fetching values for keys. PostgreSQL 8.4 added variadic function arguments, so it's easy to provide a nice interface for retrieving one or more values. The obvious one fetches a single value:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION getval(
    text
) RETURNS TEXT LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
    SELECT value FROM kvstore WHERE key = $1;
$$;


Nice and simple:


SELECT getval('baz');

 getval 
--------'
 yow


The variadic version looks like this:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION getvals(
    variadic text[]
) RETURNS SETOF text LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
    SELECT value
      FROM kvstore
      JOIN (SELECT generate_subscripts($1, 1)) AS f(i)
        ON kvstore.key = $1[i]
     ORDER BY i;
$$;


Note the use of ORDER BY i to ensure that the values are returned in the same order as the keys are passed to the function. So if I've got the key/value pairs 'foo' => 'bar' and 'baz' => 'yow', the output is:


SELECT * FROM getvals('foo', 'baz');

 getvals 
---------
 bar
 yow


If we want to the rows to have the keys and values together, we can return them as arrays, like so:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION getpairs(
    variadic text[]
) RETURNS SETOF text[] LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
    SELECT ARRAY[key, value]
      FROM kvstore
      JOIN unnest($1) AS k ON kvstore.key = k
$$;


Here I'm assuming that order isn't important, which means we can use unnest to "flatten" the array, instead of the slightly more baroque generate_subscripts() with array access. The output:


SELECT * FROM getpairs('foo', 'baz');

  getpairs   
-------------
 {baz,yow}
 {foo,bar}


Now, this is good as far as it goes, but the use of nested arrays to represent key/value pairs is not exactly ideal: just looking at the use of a function, there's nothing to indicate that you're using key/value pairs. What would be ideal is to use row constructors to pass arbitrary pairs:


SELECT store( ROW('foo', 'bar'), ROW('baz', 42) );


Alas, one cannot pass RECORD values (the data type returned by ROW()) to non-C functions in PostgreSQL.1 But if you don't mind your keys and values always being TEXT, we can get almost all the way there by creating an "ordered pair" data type as a composite type like so:


CREATE TYPE pair AS ( k text, v text );


Then we can create store() with a signature of VARIADIC pair[] and pass in any number of these suckers:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION store(
    params variadic pair[]
) RETURNS VOID LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE
    param pair;
BEGIN
    FOR param IN SELECT * FROM unnest(params) LOOP
        UPDATE kvstore
           SET value = param.v,
               expires_at = NOW() + '12 hours'::interval
         WHERE key = param.k;
        CONTINUE WHEN FOUND;
        INSERT INTO kvstore (key, value) VALUES (param.k, param.v);
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;


Isn't it nice how we can access keys and values as param.k and param.v? Call the function like this:


SELECT store( ROW('foo', 'bar')::pair, ROW('baz', 'yow')::pair );


Of course, that can get a bit old, casting to pair all the time, so let's create some pair constructor functions to simplify things:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pair(anyelement, text)
RETURNS pair LANGUAGE SQL AS 'SELECT ROW($1, $2)::pair';

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pair(text, anyelement)
RETURNS pair LANGUAGE SQL AS 'SELECT ROW($1, $2)::pair';

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pair(anyelement, anyelement)
RETURNS pair LANGUAGE SQL AS 'SELECT ROW($1, $2)::pair';

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pair(text, text)
RETURNS pair LANGUAGE SQL AS 'SELECT ROW($1, $2)::pair;';


I've created four variants here to allow for the most common combinations of types. So any of the following will work:


SELECT pair('foo', 'bar');
SELECT pair('foo', 1);
SELECT pair(12.3, 'foo');
SELECT pair(1, 43);


Alas, you can't mix any other types, so this will fail:


SELECT pair(1, 12.3);

ERROR:  function pair(integer, numeric) does not exist
LINE 1: SELECT pair(1, 12.3);


We could create a whole slew of additional constructors, but since we're using a key/value store, it's likely that the keys will usually be text anyway. So now we can call store() like so:


SELECT store( pair('foo', 'bar'), pair('baz', 'yow') );


Better, eh? Hell, we can go all the way and create a nice binary operator to make it still more sugary. Just map each of the pair functions to the operator like so:


CREATE OPERATOR -> (
    LEFTARG   = text,
    RIGHTARG  = anyelement,
    PROCEDURE = pair
);

CREATE OPERATOR -> (
    LEFTARG   = anyelement,
    RIGHTARG  = text,
    PROCEDURE = pair
);

CREATE OPERATOR -> (
    LEFTARG   = anyelement,
    RIGHTARG  = anyelement,
    PROCEDURE = pair
);

CREATE OPERATOR -> (
    LEFTARG   = text,
    RIGHTARG  = text,
    PROCEDURE = pair
);


Looks like a lot of repetition, I know, but checkout the new syntax:


SELECT store( 'foo' -> 'bar', 'baz' -> 1 );


Cute, eh? I chose to use -> because => is deprecated as an operator in PostgreSQL 9.0: SQL 2011 reserves that operator for named parameter assignment.2

As a last twist, let's rewrite getpairs() to return pairs instead of arrays:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION getpairs(
    variadic text[]
) RETURNS SETOF pair LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
    SELECT key -> value
      FROM kvstore
      JOIN unnest($1) AS k ON kvstore.key = k
$$;


Cute, eh? Its use is just like before, only now the output is more table-like:


SELECT * FROM getpairs('foo', 'baz');

  k  |   v   
-----+-------
 baz | yow
 foo | bar


You can also get them back as composites by omitting * FROM:


SELECT getpairs('foo', 'baz');

  getpairs   
-------------
 (foo,bar)
 (baz,yow)


Anyway, just something to consider the next time you need a function that allows any number of key/value pairs to be passed. It's not perfect, but it's pretty sweet.


  
  
  
    In the recent pgsql-hackers discussion that inspired this post, Pavel Stehule suggested adding something like Oracle COLLECTIONs to address this shortcoming. I don't know how far this idea will get, but it sure would be nice to be able to pass objects with varying kinds of data, rather than be limited to data all of one type (values in an SQL array must all be of the same type). ‚Ü©
  
  
     No, you won't be able to use named parameters for this application because named parameters are inherently non-variadic. That is, you can only pre-declare so many named parameters: you can't anticipate every parameter that's likely to be wanted as a key in our key/value store. ‚Ü©

titleExecute SQL Code on Connect
bodyñyI‚Äôve been writing a fair bit of PL/Perl for a client, and one of the things I‚Äôve been doing is eliminating a ton of duplicate code by creating utility functions in the %_SHARED hash. This is great, as long as the code that creates those functions gets executed at the beginning of every database connection. So I put the utility generation code into a single function, called prepare_perl_utils(). It looks something like this:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION prepare_perl_utils(
) RETURNS bool LANGUAGE plperl IMMUTABLE AS $$
    # Don't bother if we've already loaded.
    return 1 if $_SHARED{escape_literal};

    $_SHARED{escape_literal} = sub {
        $_[0] =~ s/'/''/g; $_[0] =~ s/\\/\\\\/g; $_[0];
    };

    # Create other code refs in %_SHARED‚Ä¶
$$;


So now all I have to do is make sure that all the client‚Äôs apps execute this function as soon as they connect, so that the utilities will all be loaded up and ready to go. Here‚Äôs how I did it.

First, for the Perl app, I just took advantage of the DBI‚Äôs callbacks to execute the SQL I need when the DBI connects to the database. That link might not work just yet, as the DBI‚Äôs callbacks have only just been documented and that documentation appears only in dev releases so far. Once 1.611 drops, the link should work. At any rate, the use of callbacks I‚Äôm exploiting here has been in the DBI since 1.49, which was released in November 2005.

The approach is the same as I‚Äôve described before: Just specify the Callbacks parameter to DBI->connect, like so:

my $dbh = DBI->connect_cached($dsn, $user, $pass, {
    PrintError     => 0,
    RaiseError     => 1,
    AutoCommit     => 1,
    Callbacks      => {
        connected => sub { shift->do('SELECT prepare_perl_utils()' },
    },
});


That‚Äôs it. The connected method is a no-op in the DBI that gets called to alert subclasses that they can do any post-connection initialization. Even without a subclass, we can take advantage of it to do our own initialization.

It was a bit trickier to make the same thing happen for the client‚Äôs Rails app. Rails, alas, provides no on-connection callbacks. So we instead have to monkey-patch Rails to do what we want. With some help from ‚Äúdfr|mac‚Äù on #rubyonrails (I haven‚Äôt touched Rails in 3 years!), I got it worked down to this:

class ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter
  def initialize_with_perl_utils(*args)
    returning(initialize_without_perl_utils(*args)) do
      execute('SELECT prepare_perl_utils()')
    end
  end
  alias_method_chain :initialize, :perl_utils
end


Basically, we overpower the PostgreSQL adapter‚Äôs initialize method and have it call initialize_with_perl_utils before it returns. It‚Äôs a neat trick; if you‚Äôre going to practice fuck typing, alias_method_chain makes it about as clean as can be, albeit a little too magical for my tastes.

Anyway, recorded here for posterity (my blog is my other brain!).

bodyêbI've been thinking more since I posted about testing SQL result sets, and I think I've settled on two sets of functions for pgTAP: one that tests two SQL queries (though you will be encouraged to use a prepared statement), and one to test two cursors. I'm thinking of naming them:


  query_gets()
  cursor_gets()


I had been planning on *_returns() or *_yields(), but they didn't feel
right. ‚ÄúReturns‚Äù implies that I would be passing a query and a data structure (to me at least), and while I want to support that, too, it's not what I was looking for right now. ‚ÄúYield,‚Äù on the other hand, is more related to set-returning functions in my mind (even if PL/pgSQL doesn't use that term). Anyway, I like the use of ‚Äúgets‚Äù because it's short and pretty unambiguous.

These function will compare query results as unordered sets, but I want variants that test ordered sets, as well. I've been struggling to come up with a decent name for these variants, but not liking any very well. The obvious ones are:


  ordered_query_gets()
  ordered_cursor_gets()


And:


  sorted_query_gets()
  sorted_cursor_gets()


But these are kind of long for functions that will be, I believe, used frequently. I could just add a character to get the same idea, in the spirit of sprintf:


  oquery_gets()
  ocursor_gets()


Or:


  squery_gets()
  scursor_gets()


I think that these are okay, but might be somewhat confusing. I think that the ‚Äús‚Äù variant probably won't fly, since for sprintf and friends, the ‚Äús‚Äù stands for ‚Äústring.‚Äù So I'm leaning towards the ‚Äúo‚Äù variants.

But I'm throwing it out there for the masses to make suggestions: Got any ideas for better function names? Are there some relational terms for ordered sets, for example, that might make more sense? What do you think?

As a side note, I'm also considering:


  col_is() to compare the result of a single column query to an array or other query. This would need an ordered variant, as well.
  row_is(), although I have no idea how I'd be able to support passing a row expression to a function, since PostgreSQL doesn't allow RECORDs to be passed to functions.

title$Validating Time Zones in PostgreSQL
bodyù(I recently needed to validate that a value stored in
a TEXTcolumn was a valid time zone identifier. Why? Because I was
using its value inside the database to
convert timestamp columns from
UTC to a valid zone. So I set about writing a function I could use in a
constraint.

It turns out that PostgreSQL has a pretty nice view that lists all of the
time zones that it recognizes. It's called pg_timezone_names:


try=# select * from pg_timezone_names limit 5;
        name        | abbrev | utc_offset | is_dst 
--------------------+--------+------------+--------
 Africa/Abidjan     | GMT    | 00:00:00   | f
 Africa/Accra       | GMT    | 00:00:00   | f
 Africa/Addis_Ababa | EAT    | 03:00:00   | f
 Africa/Algiers     | CET    | 01:00:00   | f
 Africa/Asmara      | EAT    | 03:00:00   | f
(5 rows)


Cool. So all I had to do was to look up the value in this view. My first
stab at creating a time zone validation function therefore looked like
this:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_timezone( tz TEXT ) RETURNS BOOLEAN as $$
DECLARE
  bool BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  SELECT TRUE INTO bool
    FROM pg_timezone_names
   WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER(tz)
      OR LOWER(abbrev) = LOWER(tz);
  RETURN FOUND;
END;
$$ language plpgsql STABLE;


This should pretty well cover anything that PostgreSQL considers valid. So
does it work? You bet:


sandy_development=# \timing
Timing is on.
sandy_development=# select is_timezone('America/Los_Angeles');
 is_timezone 
-------------
 t
(1 row)

Time: 457.096 ms
sandy_development=# select is_timezone('Foo/Bar');
 is_timezone 
-------------
 f
(1 row)

Time: 472.752 ms


Perfect! Well, except for just one thing: performance is abysmal. A half
second per shot? Not very useful for constraints. And since
pg_timezone_names is a view (and, under that, a function), I
can't create indexes.

But then I did something dangerous: I started thinking. I realized that I
needed this function when our app started getting errors like this:


try=# select now() at time zone 'Foo/Bar';
ERROR:  time zone "Foo/Bar" not recognized


So the underlying C code throws an error when a time zone is invalid. What
if I could just trap the error? Well, PL/pgSQL conveniently has exception
handling, so I could do just that. But there was only one problem. PL/pgSQL's
exception handling syntax requires that you specify an error condition. Here's
what the documentation has:


EXCEPTION
    WHEN condition [ OR condition ... ] THEN
        handler_statements
    [ WHEN condition [ OR condition ... ] THEN
          handler_statements
      ... ]
END;


Conditions are
error
codes. But which one corresponds to the invalid time zone error? I tried a
few, but couldn't figure out which one. (Anyone know now to map errors you see
in psql to the error codes listed in Appendex A? Let me know!)
But really, my function just needed to do one thing. Couldn't I just trap any
old error?

A careful re-read of the PL/pgSQL documentation reveals that, yes, you can.
Use the condition OTHERS, and you can catch almost anything. With this
information in hand, I quickly wrote:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_timezone( tz TEXT ) RETURNS BOOLEAN as $$
DECLARE
  date TIMESTAMPTZ;
BEGIN
  date := now() AT TIME ZONE tz;
  RETURN TRUE;
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
  RETURN FALSE;
END;
$$ language plpgsql STABLE;


And how well does this one work?


sandy_development=# select is_timezone('America/Los_Angeles');
 is_timezone 
-------------
 t
(1 row)

Time: 3.009 ms
sandy_development=# select is_timezone('Foo/Bar');
 is_timezone 
-------------
 f
(1 row)

Time: 1.224 ms


Yes, I'll take 1-3 ms over 400-500 ms any day! I might even
create a domain for this
and be done with it:


CREATE DOMAIN timezone AS TEXT
CHECK ( is_timezone( value ) );


Enjoy!

title&Issues with INSERT Execution Ordering
bodyœ4My latest experiments in my never-ending quest to move as much object/relational mapping into the database as possible has yielded more hacks to work around database features. This time, the problem is that I have two classes, Simple and Extend, where I want the latter to extend the former (hence its name). This is a little different from inheritance, in that, internally, an Extend just references a single Simple object, but externally, it just has a single interface, where attributes of a Simple object are just attributes of an Extend object. The benefit here is that I can have multiple Extend objects that reference the same Simple object‚Äîsomething you can't do with simple inheritance

Now, how I wanted to implement this in the database is where the extend view has all of the columns from the _simple table and the _extend table. That's pretty simple. It looks like this:


CREATE SEQUENCE seq_kinetic;

CREATE TABLE _simple (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic'),
    uuid UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT UUID_V4(),
    state INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE _extend (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic'),
    uuid UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT UUID_V4(),
    state INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    simple_id INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE VIEW extend AS
  SELECT _extend.id AS id, _extend.uuid AS uuid, _extend.state AS state,
         _extend.simple_id AS simple__id, simple.uuid AS simple__uuid,
         simple.state AS simple__state, simple.name AS name,
         simple.description AS description
  FROM   _extend, simple
  WHERE  _extend.simple_id = simple.id;


Pretty simple, right? Well, I like to put RULEs on VIEWs like this, so that I can just use the VIEW for INSERTs, UPDATEs, AND DELETESs. For now I'm just going to talk about the INSERT RULEs for this this view, as they are where the trouble came in.

Why the plural, RULEs? Well, what I wanted was to have two behaviors on insert, depending on the value of the simple__id column. If it's NOT NULL, it should assume that it references an existing record in the _simple table, UPDATE it, and then INSERT into the _extend table. If it's NULL, however, then it should INSERT into both the _simple table and the _extend table. What I came up with looked like this:


CREATE RULE insert_extend AS
ON INSERT TO extend WHERE NEW.simple__id IS NULL DO INSTEAD (
  INSERT INTO _simple (id, uuid, state, name, description)
  VALUES (NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic'), UUID_V4(), NEW.simple__state, NEW.name,
          NEW.description);

  INSERT INTO _extend (id, uuid, state, simple_id)
  VALUES (NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic'), COALESCE(NEW.uuid, UUID_V4()), NEW.state,
          CURRVAL('seq_kinetic'));
);

CREATE RULE extend_extend AS
ON INSERT TO extend WHERE NEW.simple__id IS NOT NULL DO INSTEAD (
  UPDATE _simple
  SET    state = COALESCE(NEW.simple__state, state),
         name  = COALESCE(NEW.name, name),
         description = COALESCE(NEW.description, description)
  WHERE  id = NEW.simple__id;

  INSERT INTO _extend (id, uuid, state, simple_id)
  VALUES (NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic'), COALESCE(NEW.uuid, UUID_V4()),
          NEW.state, NEW.simple__id);
);

CREATE RULE insert_extend_dummy AS
ON INSERT TO extend DO INSTEAD NOTHING;


That third RULE is required, as a VIEW must have an unconditional DO INSTEAD RULE. The second RULE also works, for those situations where I want to to extend a Simple object into an Extend object. It's that first rule that's causing problems, when no Simple object yet exists and I need to create it. When I try to INSERT with simple__id set to NULL, I get an error. Can you guess what it is? Let me not keep you on the edge or your seat:


kinetic=# INSERT INTO EXTEND (simple__id, name) VALUES (NULL, 'Four');
ERROR:  insert or update on table "_extend" violates foreign key constraint "fk_simple_id"
DETAIL:  Key (simple_id)=(22) is not present in table "_simple".


Why's that? Well, it turns out that NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic') is executed twice, once for the id in the _simple table, and once for the id in the _extend table. But by the time CURRVAL('seq_kinetic') is called to reference the value inserted into the _simple table, it the value has already been fetched from the sequence for insertion into the _extend table. So of course, it fails, because the current value in the sequence is not in the _simple table at all.

At first, I thought that this might be an order of execution problem with the INSERT statement, so I tried this:


CREATE RULE insert_extend AS
ON INSERT TO extend WHERE NEW.simple__id IS NULL DO INSTEAD (
  INSERT INTO _simple (id, uuid, state, name, description)
  VALUES (NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic'), UUID_V4(), NEW.simple__state, NEW.name,
          NEW.description);

  INSERT INTO _extend (simple_id, id, uuid, state)
  VALUES (CURRVAL('seq_kinetic'), NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic'),
          COALESCE(NEW.uuid, UUID_V4()), NEW.state);
);


Unfortunately, that yielded the same error. So if the order of the columns in the INSERT statement didn't define the execution order, what did? Well, a little research helped me to figure it out: It's the order of the columns in the table, as this example demonstrates:


test=# CREATE SEQUENCE s;
CREATE SEQUENCE
test=# CREATE TABLE a (a0 int, a1 int, a2 int, a3 int);
CREATE TABLE
test=# INSERT INTO a (a3, a2, a0, a1) VALUES (NEXTVAL('s'), NEXTVAL('s'),
test=# NEXTVAL('s'), NEXTVAL('s'));
INSERT 0 1
test=# SELECT * FROM a;
 a0 | a1 | a2 | a3 
----+----+----+----
  1 |  2 |  3 |  4
(1 row)


Even though the values from the sequence were inserted into the columns by the INSERT statement in a more or less random order, they ended up being inserted into the table in the order in which they were declared in the CREATE TABLE statement.

Damn SQL!

So what's the solution to this? Well, I came up with three. The first, and perhaps simplest, is to use two sequences instead of one:


CREATE RULE insert_extend AS
ON INSERT TO extend WHERE NEW.simple__id IS NULL DO INSTEAD (
  INSERT INTO _simple (id, uuid, state, name, description)
  VALUES (NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic'), UUID_V4(), NEW.simple__state, NEW.name,
          NEW.description);

  INSERT INTO _extend (id, uuid, state, simple_id)
  VALUES (NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic_alt'), COALESCE(NEW.uuid, UUID_V4()), NEW.state,
          CURRVAL('seq_kinetic'));
);


This works very well, and if you have separate sequences for each table, this is what you would do. But I want to use just one sequence for every primary key in the database, so as to prevent any possibility of duplicates. I could use two mutually exclusive sequences, one for odd numbers and the other for even numbers:


CREATE SEQUENCE seq_kinetic_odd INCREMENT BY 2;
CREATE SEQUENCE seq_kinetic_odd INCREMENT BY 2 START WITH 2;


But then I have to keep track of which sequence I'm using where. If I just use the even sequence for this special case (which may be rare), then I'm essentially throwing out half the numbers in the sequence. And I like things to be somewhat orderly, and the skipping of even or odd values would annoy me when I had to work with the database. Yeah, I'm a freak.

The solution I've currently worked out is to create a PL/pgSQL function that can keep track of the sequence numbers ahead of time, and just call it from the RULE:


CREATE FUNCTION insert_extend(NEWROW extend) RETURNS VOID AS '
  DECLARE
     _first_id  integer := NEXTVAL(''seq_kinetic'');
     _second_id integer := NEXTVAL(''seq_kinetic'');
  BEGIN
  INSERT INTO _simple (id, uuid, state, name, description)
  VALUES (_first_id, UUID_V4(), NEWROW.simple__state, NEWROW.name,
          NEWROW.description);

  INSERT INTO _extend (id, uuid, state, simple_id)
  VALUES (_second_id, COALESCE(NEWROW.uuid, UUID_V4()), NEWROW.state, _first_id);
  END;
' LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE;
    
CREATE RULE insert_extend AS
ON INSERT TO extend WHERE NEW.simple__id IS NULL DO INSTEAD (
  SELECT insert_extend(NEW);
);


This approach works pretty nicely, and doesn't add much more code than my original solution with the ordering problem. I think I'll keep it.

One other solution is to use a TRIGGER instead of a rule, but in truth, it would amount to nearly the same thing:


CREATE FUNCTION insert_extend() RETURNS trigger AS '
  DECLARE
     _first_id  integer := NEXTVAL(''seq_kinetic'');
     _second_id integer := NEXTVAL(''seq_kinetic'');
  BEGIN
  INSERT INTO _simple (id, uuid, state, name, description)
  VALUES (_first_id, UUID_V4(), NEW.simple__state, NEW.name, NEW.description);

  INSERT INTO _extend (id, uuid, state, simple_id)
  VALUES (_second_id, COALESCE(NEW.uuid, UUID_V4()), NEW.state, _first_id);
  END;
' LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER insert_extend BEFORE UPDATE ON extend
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE insert_extend();


Um, but looking at it now (I just now typed it up, I haven't tested it), I don't think it'd work, because you can't put a condition on a rule. On the other hand, I could use it to combine the three rules I have (two conditional and mutually exclusive, one that does nothing) into a single trigger:


CREATE FUNCTION insert_extend() RETURNS trigger AS '
  DECLARE
     _first_id  integer;
     _second_id integer;
  BEGIN
    IF NEW.simple__id IS NULL THEN
      _first_id  := NEXTVAL(''seq_kinetic'');
      _second_id := NEXTVAL(''seq_kinetic'');

      INSERT INTO _simple (id, uuid, state, name, description)
      VALUES (_first_id, UUID_V4(), NEW.simple__state, NEW.name, NEW.description);

      INSERT INTO _extend (id, uuid, state, simple_id)
      VALUES (_second_id, COALESCE(NEW.uuid, UUID_V4()), NEW.state, _first_id);
    ELSE
      UPDATE _simple
      SET    state = COALESCE(NEW.simple__state, state),
             name  = COALESCE(NEW.name, name),
             description = COALESCE(NEW.description, description)
      WHERE  id = NEW.simple__id;

      INSERT INTO _extend (id, uuid, state, simple_id)
      VALUES (NEXTVAL('seq_kinetic'), COALESCE(NEW.uuid, UUID_V4()),
              NEW.state, NEW.simple__id);
    END IF;
  END;
' LANGUAGE plpgsql;

Hrm. That just might be the best way to go, period. Thoughts? Have I missed some other obvious solution?

title-CITEXT Patch Submitted to PostgreSQL Contrib
bodyötOn Friday, I submitted a patch to add a locale-aware case-insensitive text type as a PostgreSQL contrib module. This has been among my top requests as a feature for PostgreSQL ever since I started using it. And as I started work on yet another application recently, I decided to look into what it would take to just make it happen myself. I'm hopeful that everyone will be able to benefit from this bit of yak shaving.

I started out by trying to use the citext project on pgFoundry, but immediately identified two issues with it:


  It does not install properly on PostgreSQL 8.3 (it uses a lot of casts that were removed in 8.3); and 
  It only case-insensitively compared ASCII characters. So accented multibyte characters work just as they do in the text type.


So I set about trying to create my own, new type, originally called ‚Äúlctext‚Äù, since what it does is not true case-insensitive comparisons, but lowercases text and then compares, just as millions of us developers already do by using LOWER() on both sides of a query:


SELECT *
  FROM tab
 WHERE lower(col) = LOWER(?);


I just finally got fed up with this. The last straw for me was wanting to create a primary key that would be stored case-insensitively, which would have required that I create two indexes for it: One created for the primary key by default, the other a functional UNIQUE INDEX on LOWER(col), which would just be stupid.

So this patch is the culmination of my work to make a locale-aware case-insensitive text type. It's locale-aware in that it uses the same locale-aware string comparison code as that used for the text type, and it uses the same C function as LOWER() uses. The nice thing is that it works just as if you had used LOWER() in all your SQL, but now you don't have to.

So while this is not a true case-insensitive text type, in the sense that it doesn't do a case-insensitive comparison, but changes the cases and then compares, it is likely more efficient than the LOWER() workaround that we've all been using for years, and it neater, too. Using this type, it will now be much easier to create, e.g, an email domain, like so:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_email(text)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
AS $$
    use Email::Valid;
    return TRUE if Email::Valid->address( $_[0] );
    return FALSE;
$$ LANGUAGE 'plperlu' STRICT IMMUTABLE;

CREATE DOMAIN email AS CITEXT CHECK ( is_email( value ) );


No more nasty workarounds to account for the lack of case-insensitive comparisons for text types. It works great for time zones and other data types that are defined to compare case-insensitively:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_timezone( tz TEXT ) RETURNS BOOLEAN as $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM now() AT TIME ZONE tz;
  RETURN TRUE;
EXCEPTION WHEN invalid_parameter_value THEN
  RETURN FALSE;
END;
$$ language plpgsql STABLE;

CREATE DOMAIN timezone AS CITEXT
CHECK ( is_timezone( value ) );


And that should just work!

I'm hoping that this is accepted during the July CommitFest. Of course I will welcome suggestions for how to improve it. Since I sent the patch, for example, I've been thinking that I should suggest in the documentation that it is best used for short text entries (say, up to 256 characters), rather than longer entries (like email bodies or journal articles), and that for longer entries, one should really make use of tsearch2, instead. There are other notes and caveats in the patch submission. Please do let me know what you think.

titlepgTAP 0.11 Released
bodyçmSo I've just released pgTAP 0.11. I know I said I wasn't going to work on it for a while, but I changed my mind. Here's what's changed:


  Simplified the tests so that they now load test_setup.sql instead of
    setting a bunch of stuff themselves. Now only test_setup.sql needs
    to be created from test_setup.sql.in, and the other .sql files
    depend on it, meaning that one no longer has to specify TAPSCHEMA
    for any make target other than the default.
  Eliminated all uses of E'' in the tests, so that we don't have to
    process them for testing on 8.0.
  Fixed the spelling of ON_ROLLBACK in the test setup. Can't believe I
    had it with one L in all of the test files before! Thanks to Curtis
    "Ovid" Poe for the spot.
  Added a couple of variants of todo() and skip(), since I can never
    remember whether the numeric argument comes first or second. Thanks to
    PostgreSQL's functional polymorphism, I don't have to. Also, there are
    variants where the numeric value, if not passed, defaults to 1.
  Updated the link to the pgTAP home page in pgtap.sql.in.
  TODO tests can now nest.
  Added todo_start(), todo_end(), and in_todo().
  Added variants of throws_ok() that test error messages as well as
    error codes.
  Converted some more tests to use check_test().
  Added can() and can_ok().
  Fixed a bug in check_test() where the leading whitespace for
    diagnostic messages could be off by 1 or more characters.
  Fixed the installcheck target so that it properly installs PL/pgSQL
    into the target database before the tests run.


Now I really am going to do some other stuff for a bit, although I do want to see what I can poach from Epic Test. And I do have that talk on pgTAP next month. So I'll be back with more soon enough.

title"Benchmarking PostgreSQL Functions
body£Update 2006-05-19: I realized that there was a nasty error in my
algorithm for determining the runtime of a function: It was only fetching the
milliseconds part of the runtime, without adding in seconds and minutes! This
led to getting negative runtimes then the milliseconds part of the end time was
less than the millseconds part of the start time. Ugh. But with the help of
yain on IRC, I've switched to calculating the number of seconds by
converting the start and end times to epoch seconds (which have subsecond
precision in PostgreSQL, and now things are just dandy. While I was at it, I
reorganized the function so that it was a bit easier to read, by constructing
the created function in the order it would be executed, and fixed the caching
problem, as suggested by Aidan in a comment below.

Following yesterday's post, Klint Gore sent
me some PL/pgSQL code that might be useable as a benchmark function. Today
I took that code and ran with it.

The idea was to create a function like the
Perl Benchmark
module's timethese() function. In the process, I found, with help
from Josh Berkus, that
PL/pgSQL's EXECUTE statement has quite a lot of overhead, and the
amount of overhead per call is pretty random. The overhead resulted in pretty
inaccurate benchmark numbers, unfortunately.

At Josh's suggestion, I rewrote the function to just test each function
inline, rather than passing the function code as parameters. This time, the
results were dead on. So then I refactored the original benchmark function to
create its own benchmark function, inlining all of the code, and then
call that function. Almost higher order PL/pgSQL! Again the results were just
right, and so now I present it to you:


create type _benchmark as (
    code      text,
    runtime   real,
    corrected real
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION benchmark(n INTEGER, funcs TEXT[])
RETURNS SETOF _benchmark AS $$
DECLARE
    code TEXT := '';
    a    _benchmark;
BEGIN
    -- Start building the custom benchmarking function.
    code := $_$
        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION _bench(n INTEGER)
        RETURNS SETOF _benchmark AS $__$
        DECLARE
            s TIMESTAMP;
            e TIMESTAMP;
            a RECORD;
            d numeric;
            res numeric;
            ret _benchmark;
        BEGIN
            -- Create control.
            s := timeofday();
            FOR a IN SELECT TRUE FROM generate_series( 1, $_$ || n || $_$ )
            LOOP
            END LOOP;
            e := timeofday();
            d := extract(epoch from e) - extract(epoch from s);
            ret := ROW( '[Control]', d, 0 );
            RETURN NEXT ret;
 
$_$;
    -- Append the code to bench each function call.
    FOR i IN array_lower(funcs,1) .. array_upper(funcs, 1) LOOP
        code := code || '
            s := timeofday();
            FOR a IN SELECT ' || funcs[i] || ' FROM generate_series( 1, '
                || n || $__$ ) LOOP
            END LOOP;
            e := timeofday();
            res := extract(epoch from e) - extract(epoch from s);
            ret := ROW(
                $__$ || quote_literal(funcs[i]) || $__$,
                res, 
                res - d
            );
            RETURN NEXT ret;
$__$;
    END LOOP;

    -- Create the function.
    execute code || $_$
        END;
        $__$ language plpgsql;
$_$; 

    -- Now execute the function.
    FOR a IN EXECUTE 'SELECT * FROM _bench(' || n || ')' LOOP
        RETURN NEXT a;
    END LOOP;

    -- Drop the function.
    DROP FUNCTION _bench(integer);
    RETURN;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';


You call the function like this:


try=# select * from benchmark(10000, ARRAY[
try(#     'ean_substr(''036000291452'')',
try(#     'ean_byte(''036000291452'')',
try(#     'ean_c(''036000291452'')'
try(# ]);
            code            | runtime   | corrected 
----------------------------+-----------+-----------
 [Control]                  | 0.0237451 |          0
 ean_substr('036000291452') |  0.497734 |   0.473989
 ean_byte(  '036000291452') |  0.394456 |   0.370711
 ean_c(     '036000291452') | 0.0277281 | 0.00398302
(4 rows)


Pretty slick, eh? The only downside was that, when the DROP
FUNCTION line was not commented out, the function would run
once, and then, the next time, I'd get this error:


ERROR:  cache lookup failed for function 17323
CONTEXT:  PL/pgSQL function "benchmark" line 49 at for over select rows


I have no idea why. So I just leave the function and let the
CREATE OR REPLACE take care of it.

titleBenchmarking UPC Validation
body©VJust to follow up on my query about
validating UPC codes in PL/pgSQL,
Klint Gore sent me a private email demonstrating that treating the UPC code as
a binary string performed better than my substringing approach. I modified his
version to work like the others, but it looked to me like the performace was
about the same. They were just too close for me to really be able to tell.

What I needed was a way to run the queries a whole bunch of times to see
the real difference. I asked on #postgresql, and
dennisb suggested a simple brute-force approach:

select foo(42) FROM generate_series (1, 10000);

So that's what I did. The functions I tested were:


  
    A refinement of my original substring solution:
    
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ean_substr (
    TEXT
) RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    offset integer := 0;
    -- Support UPCs.
    ean   TEXT    := CASE WHEN length($1) = 12 THEN
       '0' || $1
    ELSE
       $1
    END;
BEGIN
    -- Make sure we really have an EAN.
    IF ean !~ '^\\d{13}$' THEN RETURN FALSE; END IF;

    RETURN 10 - (
        (
          -- Sum even numerals.
            substring(ean,  2 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean,  4 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean,  6 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean,  8 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean, 10 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean, 12 + offset, 1)::integer
         ) * 3 -- Multiply total by 3.
         -- Add odd numerals except for checksum (13).
         + substring(ean,  3 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(ean,  5 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(ean,  7 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(ean,  9 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(ean, 11 + offset, 1)::integer
    -- Compare to the checksum.
    ) % 10 = substring(ean, 12 + offset, 1)::integer;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    
  

  
    A looping version, based on the comment from Adrian Klaver in the
      original post:
    
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ean_loop(
    TEXT
) RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    total INTEGER := 0;
    -- Support UPCs.
    ean   TEXT    := CASE WHEN length($1) = 12 THEN
       '0' || $1
    ELSE
       $1
    END;
BEGIN
    -- Make sure we really have an EAN.
    IF ean !~ '^\\d{13}$' THEN RETURN FALSE; END IF;

    -- Sum even numerals.
    FOR i IN 2..12 LOOP
        total := total + substring(ean, i, 1)::INTEGER;
        i := i + 1;
    END LOOP;

    -- Multiply total by 3.
    total := total * 3;

    -- Add odd numerals except for checksum (13).
    FOR i IN 3..11 LOOP
        total := total + substring(ean, i, 1)::INTEGER;
        i := i + 1;
    END LOOP;

    -- Compare to the checksum.
    RETURN 10 - total % 10
        = substring(ean, 13, 1)::INTEGER;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';
    
  

  
    A PL/Perl version for Josh and Ovid:
    
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ean_perl (
    TEXT
) RETURNS boolean AS $_$
    my $ean = length $_[0] == 12 ? "0$_[0]" : $_[0];
    # Make sure we really have an EAN.
    return 'false' unless $ean =~ /^\d{13}$/;
    my @nums = split '', shift;
    return 10 - (
        # Sum even numerals.
        (   (   $nums[1] + $nums[3] + $nums[5]
                + $nums[7] + $nums[9] + $nums[11]
            ) * 3 # Multiply total by 3.
        # Add odd numerals except for checksum (12).
        ) + $nums[2] + $nums[4] + $nums[6] + $nums[8]
          + $nums[10]
    # Compare to the checksum.
    ) % 10 == $nums[11] ? 'true' : 'false';
$_$ LANGUAGE plperl;
    
  

  
    And finally, the new version using a byte string:
    
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ean_byte (
   arg TEXT
) RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    -- Convert to BYTEA; support UPCs.
    ean BYTEA := CASE WHEN length($1) = 12 THEN
        '0' || $1
    ELSE
        $1
    END;
BEGIN
    -- Make sure we really have an EAN.
    IF arg !~ '^\\d{12,13}$' THEN RETURN FALSE; END IF;

    RETURN 10 - (
        (
            -- Sum even numerals.
            get_byte(ean,  2) - 48
          + get_byte(ean,  4) - 48
          + get_byte(ean,  6) - 48
          + get_byte(ean,  8) - 48
          + get_byte(ean, 10) - 48
          + get_byte(ean, 12) - 48
         ) * 3 -- Multiply total by 3.
         -- Add odd numerals except for checksum (13).
         + get_byte(ean,  3) - 48
         + get_byte(ean,  7) - 48
         + get_byte(ean,  5) - 48
         + get_byte(ean,  9) - 48
         + get_byte(ean, 11) - 48
    -- Compare to the checksum.
    ) % 10  = get_byte(ean, 12) - 48;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    
  


And then I ran the benchmarks:


try=# \timing
Timing is on.
try=# \o /dev/null
try=# select ean_substr('036000291452')
try-# FROM generate_series (1, 10000);
Time: 488.743 ms
try=# select ean_loop('036000291452')
try-# FROM generate_series (1, 10000);
Time: 881.553 ms
try=# select ean_perl('036000291452')
try-# FROM generate_series (1, 10000);
Time: 540.962 ms
try=# select ean_byte('036000291452')
try-# FROM generate_series (1, 10000);
Time: 395.124 ms


So the binary approach is the clear winner here, being 23.69% faster than
my substring approach, 36.91% faster than the Perl version, and 2.23 times
faster (123.11%) than the looping approach. So I think I'll go with that.

Meanwhile, I'm pleased to have this simple benchmarking tool in my arsenal
for future PostgreSQL function development.

title;How Do I Avoid Tiger's readline When Compiling PostgreSQL?
bodyà/I was delighted to find that Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger includes the readline library. So I was able to just compile PostgreSQL and have psql just work. Only it kinda doesn't. For reasons that Tom Lane has explained, Tiger's readline implementation is somewhat buggy. I've reported the issue to Apple (Radar # 4356545), but in the meantime, I've compiled and installed GNU readline 5.0 and wan to use it, instead.

The only problem is that there is no easy way to do it with environment variables or options when configuring PostgreSQL. I've tried:


./configure --includes=/usr/local/include -with-libs=/usr/local/lib


And:


CFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib LDFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include; ./configure


Neither approach worked. In both cases, it still compiled in Apple's buggy readline library. The only approach I've found to work is the brute force approach:


mv /usr/lib/libreadline.* /tmp
mv /usr/include/readline /tmp
./configure
make
make install
mv /tmp/libreadline.* /usr/lib
mv /tmp/readline /usr/include


But surely I'm missing something! Is there no better way to do it?

title!Enable CSV Logging in PostgreSQL
bodyèhOne of the cooler features of recent versions of PostgreSQL is support for
CSV-formatted
logging. I've never had a chance to use it, but after reading
Josh's cool hack for determining sums of concurrent queries using
windowing functions in PostgreSQL 8.4 to query a table generated from a CSV
log, I just had to give it a try. But while there
is decent
documentation for loading up the contents of a CSV-formatted log file,
there I couldn't find simple information on how to set it up. So I figured it
out and record it here for posterity.

Configuration is pretty straight-forward. You need to edit only two
configuration directives (known as ‚ÄúGUCs‚Äù in PostgreSQL parlance) in your
postgresql.conf file: log_destination
and logging_collector. I just changed them from:


log_destination = 'stderr'
#logging_collector = off


To:


log_destination = 'csvlog'
logging_collector = on


Then all I had to do was cold-restart PostgreSQL; that is, stop it and start it again.
I'm told that a restart won't due for security reasons. After that, I had a shiny new .csv
log file in the pg_log subdirectory of my data directory. It looks like this:


2009-08-19 10:44:08.128 PDT,,,36596,,4a8c39e8.8ef4,1,,2009-08-19 10:44:08 PDT,,0,LOG,00000,"database system was shut down at 2009-08-19 10:44:06 PDT",,,,,,,,

Cool!

The only other thing I ought to note is that, becaus I removed the ‚Äústderr‚Äù
value from the log_destination GUC, the old log location I used,
specified in my start script, is no longer necessary. I was even using
log rotation (in the default Mac OS X start script that ships with PostgreSQL),
but that's not necessary anymore, either. So I just turned that stuff off.

Now I have something to refer back to, and so do you. Enjoy!

titlePGXN Development Project
bodyêI'm pleased to announce the launch of the PGXN development project. I've written a detailed specification and pushed it through general approval on pgsql-hackers. I've written up a detailed project plan and estimated things at a highly reduced PostgreSQL Experts rate to come up with a fundraising goal: $25,000. And now, thanks to founding contributions from myYearbook.com, and PostgreSQL Experts, we have started the fundraising phase of the project.

So what‚Äôs this all about? PGXN, the PostgreSQL Extension Network, is modeled on CPAN, the Perl community‚Äôs archive of ‚Äúall things Perl.‚Äù PGXN will provide four major pieces of infrastructure to the PostgreSQL community:


An upload and distribution infrastructure for extension developers (models: PAUSE & CPAN, JAUSE)
A centralized index and API of distribution metadata (models: CPAN Meta DB, 02packages.details.txt)
A website for searching extensions and perusing their documentation (models: search.cpan.org, Kobesearch, JSAN)
A command-line client for downloading, testing, and installing extensions (models: cpanminus, CPAN.pm, JSAN Shell)


I've been wanting to start this project for a long time, but given my need to pay the bills, it didn‚Äôt seem like I'd ever be able to find the time for it. Then Josh Berkus suggested that we try to get community interest and raise money for me to have the time to work on it. So I jumped on that, putting in the hours needed to get general approval from the core PostgreSQL developers and to create a reasonable project plan and web site. And thanks to MyYearook‚Äôs and PGX‚Äôs backing, I'm really excited about it. I hope to start on it in August.

If you'd like to contribute, first: Thank You!. The PGXN site has a Google Checkout widget that makes it easy to make a donation. If you'd rather pay by some other means (checks are great for us!), drop me a line and we'll work something out. We have a few levels of contribution as well, including permanent linkage on the PGXN site for your organization, as well as the usual t-shirts launch party invitations.

title&Neither NULL nor NOT NULL: An SQL WTF
body™oWhile working on result set testing
functions, I ran into a bit of weirdness when comparing rows between two
cursors. I had code that looked more or less like this:

FETCH have INTO rec_have;
FETCH want INTO rec_want;
WHILE rec_have IS NOT NULL OR rec_want IS NOT NULL LOOP
    IF rec_have IS DISTINCT FROM rec_want THEN
        RETURN FALSE;
    END IF;
    FETCH have INTO rec_have;
    FETCH want INTO rec_want;
END LOOP;
RETURN TRUE;


Basically, the idea is to return true if the two cursors return equivalent
rows in the same order. However, things started to get weird when any of the
rows included a NULL: it seemed that the loop exited as soon as a NULL was
encountered, even if there were also non-NULL values in the row. I poked
around a bit and discovered, to my astonishment, that such a record is neither
NULL nor NOT NULL:

try=# select ROW(1, NULL) IS NULL;
 ?column? 
----------
 f
(1 row)

try=# select ROW(1, NULL) IS NOT NULL;
 ?column? 
----------
 f
(1 row)


I had thought that a value, even a composite value, had to be either NULL or
NOT NULL, so I thought it was a bug. I mean, this isn't possible, is it? I
dutifully
asked on the pgsql-hackers
list and was informed, to further astonishment, that this is, in fact,
mandated by the SQL standard.
WTF? As Jeff says,
‚ÄúThe standard is what it is. If it says that some NULLs are red and some NULLs
are blue, then we'd probably support it.‚Äù

Through the discussion, I learned that a record is considered NULL only if
all of its values are NULL, and it's considered NOT NULL only if none
of it s values are NULL:

try=# select ROW(NULL, NULL) IS NULL;
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)

try=# select ROW(1, 1) IS NOT NULL;
 ?column? 
----------
 t


The upshot is that composite values with at least one NULL and at least
one NOT NULL value are ambiguous. It's insane, but there you have it.

Jeff thought that you could cheat the standard by moving the NOT in front
of the value before checking its NULLness. I changed my code to reflect
this, and things got better:

FETCH have INTO rec_have;
FETCH want INTO rec_want;
WHILE NOT rec_have IS NULL OR NOT rec_want IS NULL LOOP
    IF rec_have IS DISTINCT FROM rec_want THEN
        RETURN FALSE;
    END IF;
    FETCH have INTO rec_have;
    FETCH want INTO rec_want;
END LOOP;
RETURN TRUE;


Kind of confusing to read, but at least it's not too ugly. In truth, however, it's still
inconsistent: it just makes it so that such records are both NULL and NOT NULL:

try=# select NOT ROW(1, NULL) IS NULL;
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)

try=# select NOT ROW(1, NULL) IS NOT NULL;
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)


But it was good enough for me. For a while. But then I started testing the
pathological scenario where a row contains only NULLs. I call it
pathological because no one should ever have rows with only NULLs. But the
truth is that the SQL standard allows it (despite the objections of
relational theorists) and, I've little doubt, application developers get such
rows all the time.

The problem with such rows is that they are inherently NULL, but, according
to the documentation for the use of
cursors in PL/pgSQL,
when fetching rows from a cursor, ‚Äúif there is no next row, the target is set
to NULL(s).‚Äù The upshot is that, because I'm using a WHILE loop to fetch
rows from a cursor, and rows with only NULLs are themselves considered
NULL, there is no way to tell the difference between a row that contains
NULLs and the end of a cursor.

To demonstrate, I
sent an example
of two functions that process a cursor, one using a plain PL/pgSQL FOR rec IN
stuff LOOP, which internally detects the difference between rows full of
NULLs and the end of the cursor, and one using the WHILE NOT rec IS NULL
LOOP syntax required by the pgTAP testing functions. The output looked like
this:

    dob     |     ssn
------------+-------------
 1965-12-31 |
            |
            | 932-45-3456
 1963-03-23 | 123-45-6789
(4 rows)

    dob     | ssn
------------+-----
 1965-12-31 |
(1 row)


The two functions are processing the same query in cursors, but while the
FOR loop properly returned all four rows, the WHILE loop stopped when it
hit a row with only NULLs. I found this annoying, to say the least.
Fortunately, other folks were paying better attention to the docs, pointing
out that the special PL/pgSQL FOUND variable does just the trick, being set
to TRUE when a row is fetched, even if the row is all NULLs, and false
then there are no more rows in the cursor. In fact, had I read two more
sentences in the
relevant documentation,
I would have noticed that it says, ‚ÄúAs with SELECT INTO, the special
variable FOUND can be checked to see whether a row was obtained or not.‚Äù
D'oh!

So now my function looks more or less like this:

FETCH have INTO rec_have;
have_found := FOUND;
FETCH want INTO rec_want;
want_found := FOUND;
WHILE have_found OR want_found LOOP
    IF rec_have IS DISTINCT FROM rec_want THEN
        RETURN FALSE;
    END IF;
    FETCH have INTO rec_have;
    have_found := FOUND;
    FETCH want INTO rec_want;
    want_found := FOUND;
END LOOP;
RETURN TRUE;


Yeah, pretty verbose and full of a lot of explicit processing that I can just
take for granted in more sane languages, but it does the trick. Don'tcha just
love SQL?

That issue behind me, I'll do a bit more hacking on it this week, and
hopefully I'll get a release of pgTAP out with the new result set testing
support before I leave for vacation early next week.

titleValidating UPCs with PL/pgSQL
bodyìSo I wanted to write a PL/pgSQL function to
validate UPC codes. The rules for validation are:


  The UPC must consist of 12 or 13 numerals
  The last numeral is a checksum for the previous 11 numerals
  The checksum is calculated as follows:
    
      Add the digits in the odd-numbered positions in the string and
      multiply by three
      Add in the digits in the even-numbered positions
      Subtract the result from the next-higher multiple of ten.
    
  


It took me a few minutes to whip up this implementation in Perl:


use List::Util qw(sum);

sub validate_upc {
    my $upc = shift;
    my @nums = split $upc;
    shift @nums if @nums == 13; # Support EAN codes.
    die "$upc is not a valid UPC" if @upc != 12;
    10 - (  sum( @nums[0,2,4,6,8,10] ) * 3
          + sum( @nums[1,3,5,7,9] )
    ) % 10 == $nums[11];
}


Trying to do the same thing in PL/pgSQL was harder, mainly because I
couldn't find an easy way to split a string up into its individual characters.
string_to_array() seems ideal, but don't follow the same rules as
Perl when it comes to the empty string:


try=% select string_to_array('123', '');
 string_to_array
 -----------------
 {123}
(1 row)


Bummer. So I had to fall back on individual calls
to substring(), instead:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_upc (
upc text
) RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    offset integer := 0;
BEGIN
    IF char_length(upc) = 13 THEN
        offset := 1;
    ELSIF char_length(upc) <> 12 THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION '% is not a valid UPC', upc;
    END IF;

    IF 10 - (
        (
            substring(upc,  1 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(upc,  3 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(upc,  5 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(upc,  7 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(upc,  9 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(upc, 11 + offset, 1)::integer
         ) * 3
         + substring(upc,  2 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(upc,  4 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(upc,  6 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(upc,  8 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(upc, 10 + offset, 1)::integer
         ) % 10  = substring(upc, 12 + offset, 1)::integer
    THEN
        RETURN true;
    ELSE
        RETURN false;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


This works, and seems pretty fast, but I'm wondering if there isn't an
easier way to do this in PL/pgSQL. Do you know of one? Leave me a comment.

titlepgTAP 0.16 in the Wild
bodyîI've been writing a lot tests for a client in pgTAP lately. It's given me a lot to think about in terms of features I need and best practices in writing tests. I'm pleased to say that, overall, it has been absolutely invaluable. I'm doing a lot of database refactoring, and having the safety of solid test coverage has been an absolute godsend. pgTAP has done a lot to free me from worry about the effects of my changes, as it ensures that everything about the databases continue to just work.

Of course, that's not to say that I don't scew up. There are times when my refactorings have introduced new bugs or incompatibilities; after all, the tests I write of existing functionality extend only so far as I can understand that functionality. But as such issues come up, I just add regression tests, fix the issues, and move on, confident in the knowledge that, as long as the tests continue to be run regularly, those bugs will never come up again. Ever.

As a result, I'll likely be posting a bit on best practices I've found while writing pgTAP tests. As I've been writing them, I've started to find the cow paths that help me to keep things sane. Most helpful is the large number of assertion functions that pgTAP offers, of course, but there are a number of techniques I've been developing as I've worked. Some are better than others, and still others suggest that I need to find other ways to do things (you know, when I'm cutt-and-pasting a lot, there must be another way, though I've always done a lot of cut-and-pasting in tests).

In the meantime, I'm happy to announce the release of pgTAP 0.16. This version includes a number of improvements to the installer (including detection of Perl and TAP::Harness, which are required to use the included pg_prove test harness app. The installer also has an important bug fix that greatly increases the chances that the os_name() function will actually know the name of your operating system. And of course, there are new test functions:


  has_schema() and hasnt_schema(), which test for the presence of absence of a schema
  has_type() and hasnt_type(), which test for the presence and absence of a data type, domain, or enum
  has_domain() and hasnt_domain(), which test for the presence and absence of a data domain
  has_enum() and hasnt_enum(), which test for the presence and absence of an enum
  enum_has_lables() which tests that an enum has an expected list of labels


As usual, you can download the latest release from pgFoundry. Visit the pgTAP site for more information and for documentation.

title#PostgreSQL Warm Standby Using Ruby
bodyå\The new PostgreSQL Warm Standby support is pretty nice. Since my app doesn't currently require  read access to a slave database, I've dumped Slony-I (and all of the headache that went with it), and now have a warm failover server being updated a least once per minute. W00t!

I used Charles Duffy's example, as well as the documentation, to build my warm standby configuration, but unfortunately, our server OS does not have the usleep utility, so rather than have 1 second sleeps, I ported Charles's shell script to Ruby. Here it is for your enjoyment:


#!/usr/bin/env ruby

DELAY         = 0.01
FAILOVER_FILE = "/path/to/failover"

@@triggered = false

require 'ftools'

def move (from, to)
  # Do not overwrite! Throws an exception on failure, existing the script.
  File.copy( from, to ) unless @@triggered || File.exists?( to )
end

from, to = ARGV

# If PostgreSQL is asking for .history, just try to move it and exit.
if from =~ /\.history$/
  move from, to
  exit
end

# Sleep while waiting for the file.
while !File.exists?(from) && !@@triggered
  sleep DELAY
  @@triggered = true if File.exists?( FAILOVER_FILE )
end

# Move the file.
move from, to


Just change the DELAY value to the number of seconds you want to sleep, and the FAILOVER_FILE value to the location of a file that will trigger a failover.

This is all well and good, but I ultimately ended up using the pg_standby utility that's a new contrib utility in PostgreSQL CVS (and will therefore ship with 8.3), as it has the nice feature of cleaning up old WAL log files. It also does not have subsecond precision, but hey, maybe we don't really need it.

title,My First C: A GTIN Data Type for PostgreSQL
bodyåAfter all of my recent experimentation creating UPC, EAN, and GTIN validation functions, I became interested in trying to create a GTIN PostgreSQL data type in C. The fact that I don't know C didn't stop me from learning enough to do some damage. And now I have a first implementation done. Check it out!

So how did I do this? Well, chapter six of the Douglas Book was a great help to get me started. I also learned what I could by reading the source code for the core and contributed PostgreSQL data types, as well as the EnumKit enumerated data type builder (download from here). And the denizens of the #postgresql channel on FreeNode were also extremely helpful. Thank you, guys!

I would be very grateful if the C hackers among you, and especially any PostgreSQL core hackers who happen to read my blog, would download the GTIN source code and have a look at it. This is the first C code I've written, so it would not surprise me if there were some gotchas that I missed (memory leaks, anyone?). And yes, I know that the new ISN contributed data types in the forthcoming 8.2 is a far more featureful implementation of bar code data types; I learned about it after I had nearly finished this first release of GTIN. But I did want to learn some C and how to create PostgreSQL data types, and provide the code for others to learn from, as well. It may also end up as the basis for an article. Stay tuned

In the meantime, share and enjoy.

Update: I forgot to mention that you can check out the source code from the  Kineticode Subversion repository.

title#PostgreSQL + OSSP UUID on Mac OS X
bodyîWanted to get this down since I just dealt with it for the second time in
the last year. The issue is this: If you
have OSSP uuid installed on Mac
OS X, and you want to build PostgreSQL with OSSP uuid support, you pass
--with-ossp-uuid to PostgreSQL's configure script.
However, you might notice this in the output:


checking ossp/uuid.h usability... no
checking ossp/uuid.h presence... yes
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h: present but cannot be compiled
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h:     check for missing prerequisite headers?
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h: see the Autoconf documentation
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h:     section "Present But Cannot Be Compiled"
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h: proceeding with the preprocessor's result
configure: WARNING: ossp/uuid.h: in the future, the compiler will take precedence
configure: WARNING:     ## ---------------------------------------- ##
configure: WARNING:     ## Report this to pgsql-bugs@postgresql.org ##
configure: WARNING:     ## ---------------------------------------- ##
checking for ossp/uuid.h... yes


The reason for this message is that OSSP uuid has symbols that conflicts
those included with Mac OS X. If you look in config.log, you'll
see something like this:


configure:13224: checking ossp/uuid.h usability
configure:13241: gcc -no-cpp-precomp -c -O2 -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Wdeclaration-after-statement -Wendif-labels -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv  -I/usr/local/include/libxml2  -I/usr/local/include conftest.c >&5
In file included from conftest.c:98:
/usr/local/include/ossp/uuid.h:94: error: conflicting types for 'uuid_t'
/usr/include/unistd.h:133: error: previous declaration of 'uuid_t' was here


It turns out that I reported this issue to OSSP a while ago. For PostgreSQL, at least
it doesn't seem to be much of a problem: the build continues and I'm able to
install the ossp-uuid contrib module without a problem. So the upshot is:
you can ignore the above warning!

One recommendation I do have, however, is to install the OSSP uuid
header file in a non-default location. Why? Because if you build Apache and APR
from source, like I do, you'll get the same failure because of conflicting
uuid_t symbols, and APR will fail to actually build! So I pass
--includedir=/usr/local/include/ossp to OSSP uuid's configure.
This has no effect on how OSSP uuid itself behaves, and the PostgreSQL is
smart enough to look there without having to be told. Meanwhile, it will then
be out of the way of your APR build (assuming you
delete /usr/local/include/uuid.h
or /usr/include/uuid.h).

title0Committed: pgTAP Result Set Assertion Functions
bodyπ]Regular readers will know that I've been thinking a lot about
testing SQL result sets and
how to how to name result testing functions,
and various implementation issues. I am very happy
to say that I've now committed the first three such test functions to the
Git repository. They've been tested
on 8.4 and 8.3. Here's what I came up with.

I had a pretty good idea how to compare sets and how to compare ordered
bags, but ordered sets and unordered bags of results escaped me. During two
days of intense hacking and experimentation, I quickly wrote
set_eq(), which performs a set comparison of the results of two
queries, and obag_eq(), which performs a row-by-row comparison of
the results of two queries. I then set to work on bag_eq(), which
would do a set comparison but require the same number of duplicate rows
between the two queries. set_eq() was easy because I just needed
to create temporary tables of the two queries and then execute
two EXCEPT queries against them to see where they differ, if at
all. bag_eq() was getting kind of hairy, though, so I asked about
it on the Freenode #postgresql channel, where depesz looked at my example and pointed out
that EXCEPT ALL would do just want I needed.

Hot damn, all it took was the addition a single extra word to the same
queries used by set_eq() and I was set. This made me very happy,
and such well-thought-out features are the reason I love PostgreSQL. My main
man depesz made my day.

But oset_eq(), which was to compare ordered sets of results was
proving much harder. The relational operators that operate on sets don't care
about order, so I would have to write the code to care myself. And because
dupes needed to be ignored, it got even harder. In fact, it proved just not
worth the effort. The main reason I abandoned this test function, though, was
not difficulties of implementation (which were significant), but ambiguity of
interpretation. After all, if duplicates are allowed but ignored, how does one
deal with their effect on order? For example, say that I have two queries that
order people based on name. One query might order them like so:


select * from people order by name;
  name  | age 
--------+-----
 Damian |  19
 Larry  |  53
 Tom    |  35
 Tom    |  44
 Tom    |  35


Another run of the same query could give me a different order:


select * from people order by name;
  name  | age 
--------+-----
 Damian |  19
 Larry  |  53
 Tom    |  35
 Tom    |  35
 Tom    |  44


Because I ordered only on ‚Äúname,‚Äù the database was free to sort records
with the same name in an undefined way. Meaning that the rows could be in
different orders. This is known, if I understand correctly, as a
‚ÄúPartially ordered set,‚Äù or
‚Äúposet.‚Äù Which is all well and good, but from my point of view makes it damn
near impossible to be able to do a row-by-row comparison and ignore dupes,
because they could be in different orders!

So once I gave up on that, I was down to three functions instead of four,
and only one depends on ordering. So I also dropped the idea of having the ‚Äúo‚Äù
in the function names. Instead, I changed obag_eq() to
results_eq(), and now I think I have three much more descriptive
names. To summarize, the functions are:


  results_eq
  Compares two result sets row by row, meaning that they must be in the same order and have the same number of duplicate rows in the same places.
  set_eq
  Compares result sets to ensure they have the same rows, without regard to order or duplicate rows.
  bag_eq
  Compares result sets without regard to order, but each must have the same duplicate rows.


I'm very happy with this, because I was able to give up on the stupid
function names with the word ‚Äúorder‚Äù included or implicit in them. Plus, I
have different names for functions that are similar, which is nicely
in adherence to the
principle of distinction. They all
provide nice diagnostics on failure, as well, like this
from results_eq():


# Failed test 146
#     Results differ beginning at row 3:
#         have: (1,Anna)
#         want: (22,Betty)


Or this from set_eq() or bag_eq()


# Failed test 146
#     Extra records:
#         (87,Jackson)
#         (1,Jacob)
#     Missing records:
#         (44,Anna)
#         (86,Angelina)


set_eq() and bag_eq() also offer up useful
diagnostics when the data types of the rows vary:


# Failed test 147
#     Columns differ between queries:
#         have: (integer,text)
#         want: (text,integer)


results_eq() doesn't have access to such data, though if I can
find some tuits (got any to give me?), I'll write a quick C function that can
return an array of the data types in a record object.

Now, as for the issue of arguments, what I settled on is,
like Epic, passing strings of SQL to these functions.
However, unlike Epic, if you pass in a simple string with no spaces, or a
double-quoted string, pgTAP assumes that it's the name of a prepared
statement. The documentation now recommends prepared statements, which you can
use like this:


PREPARE my_test AS SELECT * FROM active_users() WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
PREPARE expect AS SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = $1 AND name LIKE $2;
SELECT results_eq('my_test', 'expect');


This allows you to keep your SQL written as SQL, keeping your test, um,
SQLish. But in those cases where you have some really simple SQL, you can
just use that, too:


SELECT set_eq(
    'SELECT * FROM active_users()',
    'SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id'
);


This feels like a good compromise to me, allowing the best of both worlds:
keeping things in pure SQL to avoid quoting ugliness in SQL strings, while
letting users pass in SQL strings if they really want to.

It turns out that I wasn't able to support cursors
for set_eq() or bag_eq(), because they
use the statements passed to them to create temporary tables and then compare
the records in those temporary tables. But results_eq() uses
cursors internally. And it turns out that there's a data type for cursors,
refcursor. So it was easy to add cursor support
to results_eq() for those who want to use it:


DECLARE cwant CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM active_users();
DECLARE chave CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM users WHERE active ORDER BY name;
SELECT results_eq('cwant'::refcursor, 'chave'::refcursor );


Neat, huh? As I said, I'm very pleased with this approach overall. There
are a few caveats, such as less strict comparisons in
results_eq() on 8.3 and lower, and less useful diagnostics
for data type differences in results_eq(), but overall, I
think that the implementation is pretty good, and that these functions
will be really useful.

So what do you think? Please clone
the Git repository and take the
functions for a test drive on 8.3 or 8.4. Let me know what you think!

In the meantime, before releasing a new version, I still plan to add:


  set_includes() - Set includes records in another set.
  set_excludes() - Set excludes records in another set.
  bag_includes() - Bag includes records in another bag.
  bag_excludes() - Bag excludes records in another bag.
  col_eq() - Single column result set equivalent to an array of values.
  row_eq() - Single row form a query equivalent to a record.
  rowtype_is() - The data type of the rows in a query is equivalent to an array of types.


Hopefully I can find some time to work on those next week. The only challenging one is
row_eq(), so I may skip that one for now.

titleIntroducing pgTAP
body®NSo I started working on a new PostgreSQL data type this week. More on that
soon; in the meantime, I wanted to create a test suite for it, and wasn't sure
where to go. The only PostgreSQL tests I've seen are those distributed with
Elein
Mustain's tests for the email data type she
created in a PostgreSQL General Bits posting from a couple of years
ago. I used the same approach myself for
my GTIN data type, but it was rather hard to use: I had to pay very
close attention to what was output in order to tell the description output
from the test output. It was quite a PITA, actually.

This time, I started down the same path, then then started thinking about
Perl testing, where each unit test, or assertion, in the xUnit
parlance, triggers output of a single line of information indicating whether
or not a test succeeded. It occurred to me that I could just run a bunch of
queries that returned booleans to do my testing. So my first stab looked
something like this:


\set ON_ERROR_STOP 1
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
\pset format unaligned
\pset tuples_only
\pset pager
\pset null '[NULL]'

SELECT foo() = 'bar';
SELECT foo(1) = 'baz';
SELECT foo(2) = 'foo';


The output looked like this:


% psql try -f ~/Desktop/try.sql
t
t
t


Once I started down that path, and had written ten or so tests, It suddenly
dawned on me that the Perl Test::More module and its
core ok() subroutine worked just like that. It essentially just
depends on a boolean value and outputs text based on that value. A couple
minutes of hacking and I had this:


CREATE TEMP SEQUENCE __tc__;
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ok ( boolean, text ) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
    SELECT (CASE $1 WHEN TRUE THEN '' ELSE 'not ' END) || 'ok'
        || ' ' || NEXTVAL('__tc__')
        || CASE $2 WHEN '' THEN '' ELSE COALESCE( ' - ' || $2, '' ) END;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;


I then rewrote my test queries like so:


\echo 1..3
SELECT ok( foo() = 'bar'   'foo() should return "bar"' );
SELECT ok( foo(1) = 'baz', 'foo(1) should return "baz"' );
SELECT ok( foo(2) = 'foo', 'foo(2) should return "foo"' );


Running these tests, I now got:


% psql try -f ~/Desktop/try.sql
1..3
ok 1 - foo() should return "bar"
ok 2 - foo(1) should return "baz"
ok 3 - foo(2) should return "foo"


And, BAM! I had the beginning of a test framework
that emits pure TAP output.

Well, I was so excited about this that I put aside my data type for a few
hours and banged out the rest of the framework. Why was this exciting to me?
Because now I can use a standard test harness to run the tests, even mix them
in with other TAP tests on any project I might work on. Just now, I quickly
hacked together a quick script to run the tests:


use TAP::Harness;

my $harness = TAP::Harness->new({
    timer   => $opts->{timer},
    exec    => [qw( psql try -f )],
});

$harness->runtests( @ARGV );


Now I'm able to run the tests like so:


% try ~/Desktop/try.sql        
/Users/david/Desktop/try........ok   
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=3,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr  0.00 sys +  0.01 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.01 CPU)
Result: PASS


Pretty damn cool! And lest you wonder whether such a suite of TAP-emitting
test functions is suitable for testing SQL, here are a few exmples of tests
I've written:


-- Plan the tests.
SELECT plan(4);

-- Emit a diagnostic message for users of different locales.
SELECT diag(
    E'These tests expect LC_COLLATE to be en_US.UTF-8,\n'
  || 'but yours is set to ' || setting || E'.\n'
  || 'As a result, some tests may fail. YMMV.'
)
  FROM pg_settings
 WHERE name = 'lc_collate'
   AND setting <> 'en_US.UTF-8';

SELECT is( 'a', 'a', '"a" should = "a"' );
SELECT is( 'B', 'B', '"B" should = "B"' );

CREATE TEMP TABLE try (
    name lctext PRIMARY KEY
);

INSERT INTO try (name)
VALUES ('a'), ('ab'), ('√¢'), ('aba'), ('b'), ('ba'), ('bab'), ('AZ');

SELECT ok( 'a' = name, 'We should be able to select the value' )
  FROM try
 WHERE name = 'a';

SELECT throws_ok(
    'INSERT INTO try (name) VALUES (''a'')',
    '23505',
    'We should get an error inserting a lowercase letter'
);

-- Finish the tests and clean up.
SELECT * FROM finish();


As you can see, it's just SQL. And yes, I have ported most of the test
functions from Test::More, as well as a couple
from Test::Exception.

So, without further ado, I'd like to introduce
pgTAP, a lightweight test framework for PostgreSQL implemented
in PL/pgSQL and PL/SQL. I'll be hacking on it more in the coming days, mostly
to get a proper client for running tests hacked together. Then I think I'll
see if pgFoundry is interested in it.

Whaddya think? Is this something you could use? I can see many uses,
myself, not only for testing a custom data type as I develop it, but also
custom functions in PL/pgSQL or PL/Perl, and, heck, just regular schema stuff.
I've had to write a lot of Perl tests to test my database schema (triggers,
rules, functions, etc.), all using the DBI and being very verbose. Being able
to do it all in a single psql script seems so much cleaner. And if I cand end
up mixing the output of those scripts in with the rest of my unit tests,
so much the better!

Anyway, feedback welcome. Leave your comments, suggestions, complaints,
patches, etc., below. Thanks!

titlepgTAP Set-Testing Update
body¢<I've been thinking more
about testing SQL result sets and
how to name functions that
do such testing, and I've started to come to some conclusions. Some of the
constraints I'm looking at:


  Cursors are required for tests where the order of the results
      returned is important. It might be best for such functions to create the
      cursors themselves.
  For comparisons where order isn't important, the results of each SQL
      statement must be inserted into a temporary table and then the table
      used for the comparisons. Otherwise, each statement would be executed
      twice, as is required to calculate symmetric difference. By executing
      each once and storing the results in a temporary table, we get around
      this issue (and indeed, this one of the cases that
      Epic's
      global() function addresses).
  When order is not important, the most efficient way to compare result
      sets is with symmetric difference. However, said comparison is a set
      comparison, meaning that duplicate rows are ignored. So if set A has 3
      rows and set B has four, but two of those four are identical, then sets
      A and B can still be equivalent.


I'm starting to think that I would have two basic result set testing functions,
set_eq() and bag_eq(). The former would do a
set comparison, while the latter would require that duplicate rows be present
in both result sets. Unfortunately, that would mean that it would be
difficult for set_eq to have a variation that tests ordered
sets, as symmetric difference ignores relational ordering. And a simple
bag_eq() function would require that the relations be ordered, as
it would iterate over each row in each relation in turn and compare row to row.
But as I pointed out to
commenter ‚Äú@dave0,‚Äù bags are not inherently ordered, so it would be imposing a
requirement that's not necessarily appropriate.

This is starting to drive me a bit nuts.

I think that there are ways to enforce an ordered comparison on a set and
an unordered comparison on a bag, but both would be pretty inefficient. Maybe
I should do it anyway, include the appropriate caveats in the documentation,
and then improve when feasible in the future. In that case, what I'd be
looking at is something like this:


set_eq( sql, sql )
Test for set equivalence of two SQL statements.

oset_eq( sql, sql )
Test for ordered set equivalence of two SQL statements.

bag_eq( sql, sql )
Test for row equivalence of two SQL statements.

obag_eq( sql, sql )
Test for ordered row equivalence of two SQL statements.


The preferred tests would be set_eq() and obag_eq().
If a single word is passed to any of these functions, it's assumed to be
a prepared statement. Cursors would be created internally for the
functions that require ordered comparison. The non-ordered versions would create
temporary tables to hold the values and then use those tables for the comparisons.
 bag_eq() would also construct cursors on the temporary tables
to ensure that rows could be compared in the same order in which they were
generated by the SQL statement.

Interface-wise, perhaps a boolean would be preferred to indicate whether or
not to compare the rows in an ordered fashion? That would be:


set_eq( sql, sql, bool )
Test for set equivalence of two SQL statements. The sets must be in the same order if the boolean argument is true.

bag_eq( sql, sql, bool )
Test for row equivalence of two SQL statements. The bags must have their rows in the same order if the boolean argument is true.


I like that there are fewer functions this way, but is it harder to
remember what the boolean is for? (It would not be required, and would default
to false for both functions). Thoughts?

By the way, I would likely throw in a couple of other resultset-comparing
functions:


set_includes( sql, sql )
Test that the set returned by the first statement includes the rows returned by the second statement.
set_excludes( sql, sql )
Test that the set returned by the first statement excludes the rows returned by the second statement.
bag_includes( sql, sql )
Test that the bag returned by the first statement includes the rows returned by the second statement, including duplicates.

bag_excludes( sql, sql )
Test that the bag returned by the first statement excludes the rows returned by the second statement, including duplicates.

title(Always use the C Locale with PostgreSQL
bodyíVI ran into the weirdest bug with Bricolage today. We use the LIKE
operator to do string comparisions throughout Bricolage. In one usage, the
code checks to see if there's a record in the keyword table before
creating it. This is because keyword names are unique. So it looks for a keyword
record like this:

SELECT name, screen_name, sort_name, active
FROM   keyword
WHERE  LOWER(name) LIKE ?

If it finds a keyword, it creates a relationship between it and a story
document. If it doesn't find it, it creates a new keyword record and then
associates the new keyword with a story document.

However, one of our customers was getting SQL errors when attempting to add
keywords to a story, and it took me a while to figure out what the problem
was. This is because I couldn't replicate the problem until I started trying
to create multibyte keywords. Now, Bricolage uses a UTF-8 PostgreSQL database,
but something very odd was going on. When I attempted to add the
keyword Î∂ÅÌïúÏùò, it didn't find an existing keyword, but then threw an
error when the unique index thought it existed already! Running tests
in psql, I found that = would find the existing
record, but LIKE wouldn't!

Once I posted a query on the pgsql-general list, someone noticed that the record returned
when using = actually had a different value than was actually
queried for. I had searched for Î∂ÅÌïúÏùò, but the database found Íµ≠Î∞©ÎπÑ. It seems that = compares bytes, while LIKE compares
characters. The error I was getting meant that the unique index was also using bytes. And
because of the locale used when initdb was run, PostgreSQL thought that they
actually were the same!

The solution to this problem, it turns out, was to dump the database, shut down
PostgreSQL, move the old data directory, and create a new one with initdb -locale=C.
I then restored the database, and suddenly = and LIKE (and the unique
index) were doing the same thing. Hallelujah!

Naturally, I'm not the first to notice this issue. It's particularly an issue with RedHat Linux
installations, since RedHat has lately decided to set a system-wide locale. In my case, it was en_US.UTF-8. This apparently can break collations in other languages, and this affects indices, of course. So I
was led to wonder if initdb shouldn't default to a locale of C instead of
the system default. What do you think?

title$Thoughts on Testing SQL Result Sets
body¸/pgTAP: The Critique

I've been continuing hacking on pgTAP in order to add a lot more
schema-testing functionality and a few other niceties. But back when I started
the project, I using it to write tests for CITEXT, which was great for my
sanity as I developed it, but proved a bit controversial. In a
pgsql-hackers post, Tom Lane wrote:

There was some discussion earlier about whether the proposed regression
tests for citext are suitable for use in contrib or not.  After playing
with them for awhile, I have to come down very firmly on the side of
"not".  I have these gripes:


The style is gratuitously different from every other regression test
in the system.  This is not a good thing.  If it were an amazingly
better way to do things, then maybe, but as far as I can tell the style
pgTAP forces on you is really pretty darn poorly suited for SQL tests.
You have to contort what could naturally be expressed in SQL as a table
result into a scalar. Plus it‚Äôs redundant with the expected-output file.
It‚Äôs ridiculously slow; at least a factor of ten slower than doing
equivalent tests directly in SQL.  This is a very bad thing.  Speed of
regression tests matters a lot to those of us who run them a dozen times
per day ‚Äî‚Äì and I do not wish to discourage any developers who don‚Äôt
work that way from learning better habits ;‚Äì)



Because of #1 and #2 I find the use of pgTAP to be a nonstarter.

These are legitimate criticisms, of course. To take the second item first, I
would eventually like to figure out a way to make pgTAP a lot faster (in my
own benchmarks, I found it to be about 4 times slower than pure SQL, not ten
times, but still). A number of functions can likely be rewritten in C, and
maybe data can be stored in memory rather than in a temporary table. Overall,
though, the speed of the tests doesn‚Äôt really concern me much. I'm quite used
to large test suites, such as that for Bricolage, that take 5 or 10
minutes or more. This is because, compared to the time it would take me to
maintain the code without tests, it‚Äôs nothing. I find and fix bugs much more
quickly thanks to regression tests. And really, one should just run a subset
of the tests for whatever one is working on, and then run the full suite
before checking in. One could even have a larger, more comprehensive (read:
slower) test suite that‚Äôs run via a cron job, so that it identifies bugs in
checked in code but developers don‚Äôt have to spend a lot of time waiting for
tests to finish running.

As a result, I wouldn‚Äôt advocate for converting the existing PostgreSQL
regression test suite to pgTAP. I could see writing a new suite of tests on
pgTAP that run on the build farm. This would be great, as they would
complement the existing test suite, and be able to test stuff that can‚Äôt be
tested with pg_regress.

So really, the performance issue can be addressed in a few ways, some
technical, some social, some structural. Like I said, I'm not overly concerned
about it, and I wouldn‚Äôt make Tom suffer unduly from it, either (I converted
all of the CITEXT tests to plain SQL).

Coercing Composite Values

The first issue is tougher, however. Tom was responding to a test like this:

SELECT is(
    ARRAY( SELECT name FROM srt ORDER BY name )::text,
    ARRAY['AAA', 'aardvark', 'aba', 'ABC', 'abc']::text,
    'The words should be case-insensitively sorted'
);


Now, I agree that it‚Äôs redundant with the expected-output file, but the
assumption with TAP is that there is no expected output file: you just
analyze its output using a harness. The need for an expected output file
is driven by the legacy of pg_regress.

A bigger issue, and the one I'll focus on for the remainder of this post, is
the requirement currently inherent in pgTAP to ‚Äúcontort what could naturally
be expressed in SQL as a table result into a scalar.‚Äù The issue is apparent in
the above example: even though I'm selecting a number of rows from a table, I
use the ARRAY() constructor function to force them into a scalar value‚Äîan
array‚Äîin order to easily do the comparison. It also results in a useful
diagnostic message in case the test fails:

# Failed test 40: "The words should be case-insensitively sorted"
#         have: {AAA,aardvark,ABC,abc,aba}
#         want: {AAA,aardvark,aba,ABC,abc}


So for simple cases like this, it doesn‚Äôt bother me much personally. But I've
also had to write tests for functions that return composite types‚Äîthat is,
rows‚Äîand again I had to fall back on coercing them into scalar values to do
the comparison. For example, say that the fooey() function returns a dude
value, which is a composite type with an integer and a text string. Here‚Äôs how
to test it with pgTAP:

SELECT is(
    fooey()::text,
    ROW( 42, 'Bob' )::text,
    'Should get what we expect from fooey()'
);


So I'm again coercing a value into something else (of course, if I could pass
records to functions, that issue goes away). And it does yield nice
diagnostics on failure:

# Failed test 96: "Should get what we expect from fooey()"
#         have: (42,Fred)
#         want: (42,Bob)


It gets much worse with set returning functions‚ÄîTom‚Äôs ‚Äútable result:‚Äù it
requires both type and row coercion (or ‚Äúcontortion‚Äù if you'd prefer). Here‚Äôs
an example of a fooies() function that returns a set of dudes:

SELECT is(
    ARRAY( SELECT ROW(f.*)::text FROM fooies() f ),
    ARRAY[
        ROW( 42, 'Fred' )::text,
        ROW( 99, 'Bob' )::text
    ],
    'Should get what we expect from fooies()'
);


As you can see, it‚Äôs do-able, but clumsy and error prone. We really are taking
a table result and turning into a scalar value. And thanks to the casts to
text, the test can actually incorrectly pass if, for example, the integer
was actually stored as text (although, to be fair, the same is true of a
pg_regress test, where everything is converted to text before comparing
results).

What we really need is a way to write two queries and compare their result
sets, preferably without any nasty casts or coercion into scalar values, and
with decent diagnostics when a test fails.

As an aside, another approach is to use EXCEPT queries to make sure that two
data sets are the same:

SELECT ok(
    NOT EXISTS (
        (SELECT 42, 'Fred' UNION SELECT 99, 'Bob')
        EXCEPT
        SELECT * from fooies()
    ),
    'Should get what we expect from fooies()'
);

SELECT ok(
    NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT * from fooies()
        EXCEPT
        (SELECT 42, 'Fred' UNION SELECT 99, 'Bob')
    ),
    'Should have no unexpected rows from fooies()'
);


Here I've created two separate tests. The first makes sure that fooies()
returns all the expected rows, and the second makes sure that it doesn‚Äôt
return any unexpected rows. But since this is just a boolean test (yes, we've
coerced the results into booleans!), there are no diagnostics if the test
fails: you'd have to go ahead and run the query yourself to see what‚Äôs
unexpected. Again, this is do-able, and probably a more correct comparison
than using the casts of rows to text, but makes it harder to diagnose
failures. And besides, EXCEPT compares sets, which are inherently unordered.
That means that if you need to test that results come back in a specific
order, you can‚Äôt use this approach.

That said, if someone knows of a way to do this in one query‚Äîsomehow make
some sort of NOT EXCEPT operator work‚ÄîI'd be very glad to hear it!

Prior Art

pgTAP isn‚Äôt the only game in town. There is also Dmitry Koterov‚Äôs PGUnit
framework and Bob Brewer‚Äôs Epic. PGUnit seems to have one main assertion
function, assert_same(), which works much like pgTAP‚Äôs is(). Epic‚Äôs
assert_equal() does, too, but Epic also offers a few functions for testing
result sets that neither pgTAP nor PGUnit support. One such function is
assert_rows(), to which you pass strings that contain SQL to be evaluated.
For example:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test.test_fooies() RETURNS VOID AS $_$
BEGIN
    PERFORM test.assert_rows(
        $$ VALUES(42, 'Fred'), (99, 'Bob') $$,
        $$ SELECT * FROM fooies()          $$
    );
  RAISE EXCEPTION '[OK]';
END;
$_$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


This works reasonably well. Internally, Epic runs each query twice, using
EXCEPT to compare result sets, just as in my boolean example above. This
yields a proper comparison, and because assert_rows() iterates over returned
rows, it emits a useful message upon test failure:

psql:try_epic.sql:21: ERROR:  Record: (99,Bob) from: VALUES(42, 'Fred'), (99, 'Bob') not found in: SELECT * FROM fooies()
CONTEXT:  SQL statement "SELECT  test.assert_rows( $$ VALUES(42, 'Fred'), (99, 'Bob') $$, $$ SELECT * FROM fooies() $$ )"
PL/pgSQL function "test_fooies" line 2 at PERFORM


A bit hard to read with all of the SQL exception information, but at least the
information is there. At PGCon, Bob told me that passing strings of SQL
code made things a lot easier to implement in Epic, and I can certainly see
how that could be (pgTAP uses SQL code strings too, with its throws_ok(),
lives_ok(), and performs_ok() assertions). But it just doesn‚Äôt feel
SQLish to me. I mean, if you needed to write a really complicated query, it
might be harder to maintain: even using dollar quoting, it‚Äôs harder to track
stuff. Furthermore, it‚Äôs slow, as PL/pgSQL‚Äôs EXECUTE must be called twice
and thus plan twice. And don‚Äôt even try to test a query with
side-effects‚Äîsuch as a function that inserts a row and returns an ID‚Äîas the
second run will likely lead to test failure just might blow something up.

SQL Blocks?

One approach is to use blocks. I'm thinking here of something like Ruby blocks
or Perl code references: a way to dynamically create some code that is
compiled and planned when it loads, but its execution can be deferred. In Perl
it works like this:

my $code = sub { say "woof!" };
$code->(); # prints "woof!"


In Ruby (and to a lesser extent in Perl), you can pass a block to a method:

foo.bar { puts "woof!" }


The bar method can then run that code at its leisure. We can sort of do this
in PostgreSQL using PREPARE. To take advantage of it for Epic‚Äôs
assert_rows() function, one can do something like this:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test.test_fooies() RETURNS VOID AS $_$
BEGIN
    PREPARE want AS VALUES(42, 'Fred'), (99, 'Bob');
    PREPARE have AS SELECT * FROM public.fooies();
    PERFORM test.assert_rows(
        test.global($$ EXECUTE want $$),
        test.global($$ EXECUTE have $$)
    );
    RAISE EXCEPTION '[OK]';
END;
$_$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


The nice thing about using a prepared statement is that you can actually write
all of your SQL in SQL, rather than in an SQL string, and then pass the simple
EXECUTE statement to assert_rows(). Also note the calls to test.global()
in this example. This is a tricky function in Epic that takes an SQL
statement, turns its results into a temporary table, and then returns the
table name. This is required for the EXECUTE statements to work properly,
but a nice side-effect is that the actual queries are executed only once each,
to create the temporary tables. Thereafter, those temporary tables are used to
fetch results for the test.

Another benefit of prepared statements is that you can write a query once and
use it over and over again in your tests. Say that you had a few set returning
functions that return different results from the users table. You could then
test them all like so:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test.test_user_funcs() RETURNS VOID AS $_$
BEGIN
    PREPARE want(bool) AS SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = $1;
    PREPARE active     AS SELECT * FROM get_active_users();
    PREPARE inactive   AS SELECT * FROM get_inactive_users();
    PERFORM test.assert_rows(
        test.global($$ EXECUTE want(true) $$),
        test.global($$ EXECUTE active     $$)
    );
    PERFORM test.assert_rows(
        test.global($$ EXECUTE want(false) $$),
        test.global($$ EXECUTE inactive    $$)
    );
    RAISE EXCEPTION '[OK]';
END;
$_$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


Note how I've tested both the get_active_users() and the
get_inactive_users() function by passing different values when executing the
want prepared statement. Not bad. I think that this is pretty SQLish, aside
from the necessity for test.global().

Still, the use of prepared statements with Epic‚Äôs assert_rows() is not
without issues. There is still a lot of execution here (to create the
temporary tables and to select from them a number of times). Hell, this last
example reveals an inefficiency in the creation of the temporary tables, as
the two different executions of have create two separate temporary tables
for data that‚Äôs already in the users table. If you have a lot of rows to
compare, a lot more memory will be used. And you still can‚Äôt check the
ordering of your results, either.

So for small result sets and no need to check the ordering of results, this is
a pretty good approach. But there‚Äôs another.

Result Set Handles

Rather than passing blocks to be executed by the tests, in many dynamic
testing frameworks you can pass data structures be compared. For example,
Test::More‚Äôs is_deeply() assertion allows you to test that two data
structures contain the same values in the same structures:

is_deeply \@got_data, \@want_data, 'We should have the right stuff';


This does a deep comparison between the contents of the @got_data array and
@want_data. Similarly, I could imagine a test to check the contents of a
DBIx::Class result set object:

results_are( $got_resultset, $want_resultset );


In this case, the is_results() function would iterate over the two result
sets, comparing each result to make sure that they were identical. So if
prepared statements in SQL are akin to blocks in dynamic languages, what is
akin to a result set?

The answer, if you're still with me, is cursors.

Now, cursors don‚Äôt work with Epic‚Äôs SQL-statement style tests, but I could
certainly see how a pgTAP function like this would be useful:

DECLARE want CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM users WHERE active;
DECLARE have CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM get_active_users();
SELECT results_are( 'want', 'have' );


The nice thing about this approach is that, even more than with prepared
statements, everything is written in SQL. The results_are() function would
simply iterate over each row returned from the two cursors to make sure that
they were the same. In the event that there was a difference, the diagnostic
output would be something like:

#   Failed test 42:
#     Results begin differing at row 3:
#          have: (3,Larry,t)
#          want: (3,Larry,f)


So there‚Äôs a useful diagnostic, ordering is preserved, no temporary tables are
created, and the data is fetched directly from its sources (tables or
functions or whatever) just as it would be in a straight SQL statement. You
still have the overhead of PL/pgSQL‚Äôs EXECUTE, and iterating over the
results, but, outside of some sort of NOT INTERSECT operator, I don‚Äôt see
any other way around it.

The Plan

So I think I'll actually look at adding support for doing this in two ways:
one with prepared statements (or query strings, if that‚Äôs what floats your
boat) like Epic does, though I'm going to look at avoiding the necessity for
something like Epic‚Äôs global() function. But I'll also add functions to test
cursors. And maybe a few combinations of these things.

So, does an approach like this, especially the cursor solution, address Tom‚Äôs
criticism? Does it feel more relational? Just to rewrite the kind of test Tom
originally objected to, it would now look something like this:

DECLARE have CURSOR FOR SELECT name FROM srt ORDER BY name;
DECLARE want CURSOR FOR VALUES ('AAA'), ('aardvark'), ('aba'), ('ABC'), ('abc');
SELECT results_are(
    'have', 'want',
    'The words should be case-insensitively sorted'
);


Thoughts? I'm not going to get to it this week, so feedback would be greatly
appreciated.

Can nothing be done to stop this menace? Its use leads to cleaner, more
stable, and more-safely refctored code. This insanity must be stopped! Please
review the following list of its added vileness since 0.19 to determine how
you can stop the terrible, terrible influence on your PostgreSQL unit-testing
practices that is pgTAP:


Changed the names of the functions tested in sql/do_tap.sql and
sql/runtests.sql so that they are less likely to be ordered differently
given varying collation orders provided in different locales and by
different vendors. Reported by Ingmar Brouns.
Added the --formatter and --archive options to pg_prove.
Fixed the typos in pg_prove where the output of --help listed
--test-match and --test-schema instead of --match and --schema.
Added has_cast(), hasnt_cast(), and cast_context_is().
Fixed a borked function signature in has_trigger().
Added has_operator(), has_leftop(), and has_rightop().
Fixed a bug where the order of columns found for multicolum indexes by
has_index() could be wrong. Reported by Jeff Wartes. Thanks to Andrew
Gierth for help fixing the query.


Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did, where I wrote a lot of pgTAP tests for a client, and now testing database upgrades from 8.2 to 8.3 is just too reliable! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Good luck with your mission.

titleEnforcing a Set of Values
body·Enumerate Me

I love enums. They're a terrific way to quickly create self-documenting data types that represent a set of values, and the nice thing is that the underlying values are stored as integers, making them very space- and performance-efficient. A typical example might be a workflow approval process for publishing magazine articles. You create it like so:


CREATE TYPE article_states AS ENUM (
    'draft', 'copy', 'approved', 'published'
);


Nice: we now have a simple data type that‚Äôs self-documenting. An an important feature of enums is that the ordering of values is the same as the declared labels. For a workflow such as this, it makes a lot of sense, because the workflow states are inherently ordered: ‚Äúdraft‚Äù comes before ‚Äúcopy‚Äù and so on.

Unfortunately, enums aren‚Äôt a panacea. I would use them all over the place if I could, but, alas, the value-set data types I tend to need tend not to have inherently ordered values other than the collation order of the text. For example, say that we need a table describing people‚Äôs faces. Using an enum to manage eye colors might look something like this:


CREATE TYPE eye_color AS ENUM ( 'blue', 'green', 'brown' );

CREATE TABLE faces (
    face_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    eye_color eye_color NOT NULL
);


Nice, huh? So let‚Äôs insert a few values and see what it looks like:


INSERT INTO faces (name, eye_color)
VALUES ('David', 'blue' ),
       ('Julie', 'green' ),
       ('Anna', 'blue' ),
       ('Noriko', 'brown' )
;


So let‚Äôs look at the data ordered by the enum:


% SELECT name, eye_color FROM faces ORDER BY eye_color;
  name  | eye_color 
--------+-----------
 David  | blue
 Anna   | blue
 Julie  | green
 Noriko | brown


Hrm. That‚Äôs not good. I forgot to put ‚Äúgreen‚Äù after ‚Äúbrown‚Äù when I created the enum. Oh, and I forgot the color ‚Äúhazel‚Äù:


% INSERT INTO faces (name, eye_color) VALUES ('Kat', 'hazel' );
ERROR:  invalid input value for enum eye_color: "hazel"


Well, nice to know that it‚Äôs enforced, and that message is really helpful. But the real problem is that we run into the inherent ordering of enum labels, and now we need to adjust the enum to meet our needs. Here‚Äôs how to do it:


ALTER TABLE faces RENAME eye_color TO eye_color_tmp;
ALTER TABLE faces ALTER eye_color_tmp TYPE TEXT;
DROP TYPE eye_color;
CREATE TYPE eye_color AS ENUM ( 'blue', 'brown', 'green', 'hazel' );
ALTER TABLE faces ADD eye_color eye_color;
UPDATE faces SET eye_color = eye_color_tmp::eye_color;
ALTER TABLE faces ALTER eye_color SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE faces DROP column eye_color_tmp;


Yikes! I have to rename the column, change its type to TEXT, drop the enum, create a new enum, and then copy all of the data into the new column before finally dropping the old column. If I have a lot of data, this will not be very efficient, requiring that every single row be rewritten. Still, it does work:


% INSERT INTO faces (name, eye_color) VALUES ('Kat', 'hazel' );
% SELECT name, eye_color FROM faces ORDER BY eye_color;
  name  | eye_color 
--------+-----------
 David  | blue
 Anna   | blue
 Noriko | brown
 Julie  | green
 Kat    | hazel


The upshot is that enums are terrific if you have a very well-defined set of values that are inherently ordered (or where order is not important) and that are extremely unlikely to change. Perhaps someday PostgreSQL will have a more robust ALTER TYPE that allows enums to be more efficiently reorganized, but even then it seems likely that re-ordering values will require a table rewrite.

Lookup to Me

Another approach to handling a type as a set of values is to take advantage of the relational model and create store the values in a table. Going with the faces example, it looks like this:


CREATE TABLE eye_colors (
    eye_color TEXT PRIMARY KEY
);

INSERT INTO  eye_colors VALUES( 'blue' ), ('green'), ('brown' );

CREATE TABLE faces (
    face_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    eye_color TEXT REFERENCES eye_colors(eye_color)
);


We can use this table much as we did before:


INSERT INTO faces (name, eye_color)
VALUES ('David', 'blue' ),
       ('Julie', 'green' ),
       ('Anna', 'blue' ),
       ('Noriko', 'brown' )
;


And of course we can get the rows back properly ordered by eye_color, unlike the original enum example:


% SELECT name, eye_color FROM faces ORDER BY eye_color;
  name  | eye_color 
----+------
 David  | blue
 Anna   | blue
 Noriko | brown
 Julie  | green


Cool! But there are a couple of downsides. One is that you're adding a bit of I/O overhead to every update. Most likely you won‚Äôt have very many values in the eye_colors table, so given PostgreSQL‚Äôs caching, this isn‚Äôt a big deal. A bigger deal is error handling:


INSERT INTO eye_colors VALUES ('hazel');
ERROR:  insert or update on table "faces" violates foreign key constraint "faces_eye_color_fkey"


That‚Äôs not an incredibly useful error message. One might ask, without knowing the schema, what has an eye color has to do with a foreign key constraint? At least looking at the tables can tell you a bit more:


% \dt
          List of relations
 Schema |    Name    | Type  | Owner 
----+------+----+----
 public | eye_colors | table | david
 public | faces      | table | david


A quick look at the eye_colors table will tell you what‚Äôs going on, and you can figure out that you just need to add a new row:


INSERT INTO eye_colors VALUES ('hazel');
INSERT INTO faces (name, eye_color) VALUES ('Kat', 'hazel' );


So it is self-documenting, but unlike enums it doesn‚Äôt do a great job of it. Plus if you have a bunch of set-constrained value types, you can end up with a whole slew of lookup tables. This can make it harder to sort the important tables that contain actual business data from those that are just lookup tables, because there is nothing inherent in them to tell the difference. You could put them into a separate schema, of course, but still, it‚Äôs not exactly intuitive.

Given these downsides, I'm not a big fan of using lookup tables for managing what is in fact a simple list of allowed values for a particular column unless those values change frequently. So what else can we do?

Constrain Me

A third approach is to use a table constraint, like so:


CREATE TABLE faces (
    face_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    eye_color TEXT NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT valid_eye_colors CHECK (
        eye_color IN ( 'blue', 'green', 'brown' )
    )
);


No lookup table, no inherent ENUM ordering. And in regular usage it works just like the lookup table example. The usual INSERT and SELECT once again yields:


% SELECT name, eye_color FROM faces ORDER BY eye_color;
  name  | eye_color 
----+------
 David  | blue
 Anna   | blue
 Noriko | brown
 Julie  | green


The error message, however, is a bit more helpful:


% SELECT name, eye_color FROM faces ORDER BY eye_color;
ERROR:  new row for relation "faces" violates check constraint "valid_eye_colors"


A check constraint violation on eye_color is much more informative than a foreign key constraint violation. The downside to a check constraint, however, is that it‚Äôs not as self-documenting. You have to look at the entire table in order to find the constraint:


% \d faces
                             Table "public.faces"
  Column   |  Type   |                        Modifiers                        
------+-----+-----------------------------
 face_id   | integer | not null default nextval('faces_face_id_seq'::regclass)
 name      | text    | not null default ''::text
 eye_color | text    | not null
Indexes:
    "faces_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (face_id)
Check constraints:
    "valid_eye_colors" CHECK (eye_color = ANY (ARRAY['blue', 'green', 'brown']))


There it is at the bottom. Kind of tucked away there, eh? At least now we can change it. Here‚Äôs how:


ALTER TABLE faces DROP CONSTRAINT valid_eye_colors;
ALTER TABLE faces ADD CONSTRAINT valid_eye_colors CHECK (
    eye_color IN ( 'blue', 'green', 'brown', 'hazel' )
);


Not as straight-forward as updating the lookup table, and much less efficient (because PostgreSQL must validate that existing rows don‚Äôt violate the constraint before committing the constraint). But it‚Äôs pretty simple and at least doesn‚Äôt require the entire table be UPDATEd as with enums. For occasional changes to the value list, a table scan is not a bad tradeoff. And of course, once that‚Äôs done, it just works:


INSERT INTO eye_colors VALUES ('hazel');
INSERT INTO faces (name, eye_color) VALUES ('Kat', 'hazel' );


So this is almost perfect for our needs. Only poor documentation persists as an issue.

This is My Domain

To solve that problem, switch to domains. A domain is simply a custom data type that inherits behavior from another data type and to which one or more constraints can be added. It‚Äôs pretty simple to switch from the table constraint to a domain:


CREATE DOMAIN eye_color AS TEXT
CONSTRAINT valid_eye_colors CHECK (
    VALUE IN ( 'blue', 'green', 'brown' )
);

CREATE TABLE faces (
    face_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    eye_color eye_color NOT NULL
);


Nice table declaration, eh? Very clean. Looks exactly like the enum example, in fact. And it works as well as the table constraint:


% SELECT name, eye_color FROM faces ORDER BY eye_color;
  name  | eye_color 
----+------
 David  | blue
 Anna   | blue
 Noriko | brown
 Julie  | green


A constraint violation is a bit more useful than with the table constraint:


% SELECT name, eye_color FROM faces ORDER BY eye_color;
ERROR:  value for domain eye_color violates check constraint "valid_eye_colors"


This points directly to the domain. It'd be nice if it mentioned the violating value the way the enum error did, but at least we can look at the domain out like so:


\dD eye_color
                                                        List of domains
 Schema |   Name    | Type | Modifier |                                         Check                                          
----+------+---+-----+--------------------------------------------
 public | eye_color | text |          | CHECK (VALUE = ANY (ARRAY['blue', 'green', 'brown', 'hazel']))


None of the superfluous stuff about the entire table to deal with, just the constraint, thank you very much. Changing it is just as easy as changing the table constraint:


ALTER DOMAIN eye_color DROP CONSTRAINT valid_eye_colors;
ALTER DOMAIN eye_color ADD CONSTRAINT valid_eye_colors CHECK (
    VALUE IN ( 'blue', 'green', 'brown', 'hazel' )
);


Yep, you can alter domains just as you can alter tables. And of course now it will work:


INSERT INTO eye_colors VALUES ('hazel');
INSERT INTO faces (name, eye_color) VALUES ('Kat', 'hazel' );


And as usual the data is well-ordered when we need it to be:


% SELECT name, eye_color FROM faces ORDER BY eye_color;
  name  | eye_color 
----+------
 David  | blue
 Anna   | blue
 Noriko | brown
 Julie  | green
 Kat    | hazel


And as an added bonus, if you happened to need an eye color in another table, you can just use the same domain and get all the proper semantics. Sweet!

Color Me Happy

Someday I'd love to see support for a PostgreSQL feature like enums, but allowing an arbitrary list of strings that are ordered by the contents of the text rather than the order in which they were declared, and that‚Äôs efficient to update. Maybe it could use integers for the underlying storage, too, and allow values to be modified without a table rewrite. Such would be the ideal for this use case. Hell, I'd find it much more useful than enums.

But domains get us pretty close to that without too much effort, so maybe it‚Äôs not that important. I've tried all of the above approaches and discussed it quite a lot with my colleagues before settling on domains, and I'm quite pleased with it. The only caveat I'd have is that it‚Äôs not to be used lightly. If the value set is likely to change fairly often (at least once a week, say), then you'd be better off with the lookup table.

In short, I recommend:


For an inherently ordered set of values that‚Äôs extremely unlikely to ever change, use an enum.
For a set of values that won‚Äôt often change and has no inherent ordering, use a domain.
For a set of values that changes often, use a lookup table.


What do you use to constrain a column to a defined set of unordered values?

title)Use Variables in PL/pgSQL DECLARE Blocks
bodyä}I'm working on some PL/pgSQL functions for my application framework and for an upcoming article for the O'Reilly Databases site, and was showing some of the code to a PostgreSQL guru. The code looked something like this:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_table (
    key_name text,
    pk_id    integer,
    fk_ids   integer[]

) RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    table_name text := quote_ident(key_name);
BEGIN
    EXECUTE 'UPDATE ' || table_name || ' SET pk = ' || pk_id
         || ' WHERE fk IN(' || array_to_string(fk_ids, ', ')
         || ')';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


No, that's not the real code, it's just a dummy example to illustrate something. Illustrate what? Well, my PostgreSQL friend said, Crap, can you really use variables to set other variables in the DECLARE section? The answer is yes, of course. The above does work. I'm new to PostgreSQL functions, so I didn't know any better than to just try it, and it worked. But my friend has been writing PL/pgSQL functions for years. Why didn't he know that you could use variables in a DECLARE block? As he said, Damn, one of the problems with starting with a language 6 years ago is that you get in the habit of coding around the restrictions from 6 years ago.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this tidbit, in case there were other PostgreSQL pros who missed it. I don't know when the feature was added, but it works fine for me in 8.1.

title'pgTAP 0.10 Released, Web Site Launched
bodyçDTwo major announcements this week with regard to pgTAP:

First, I've release pgTAP 0.10. The two major categories of changes are
compatibility as far back as PostgreSQL 8.0 and new functions for testing
database schemas. Here's a quick example:


BEGIN;
SELECT plan(7);

SELECT has_table( 'users' );
SELECT has_pk('users');
SELECT col_is_fk( 'users', ARRAY[ 'family_name', 'given_name' ]);

SELECT has_table( 'widgets' );
SELECT has_pk( 'widgets' );
SLEECT col_is_pk( 'widgets', 'id' );
SELECT fk_ok(
    'widgets',
    ARRAY[ 'user_family_name', 'user_given_name' ],
    'users',
    ARRAY[ 'family_name', 'given_name' ],
);

SELECT * FROM finish();
ROLLBACK;


Pretty cool, right?
Check the documentation for all the
details.

Speaking of the documentation, that link goes to the
new pgTAP
Web site. Not only does it include the complete documentation for pgTAP,
but also instructions
for integrating pgTAP into your application's
preferred test environment. Right now it includes detailed instructions for
Perl + Module::Build and for PostgreSQL, but has only placeholders for PHP
and Python. Send me the details on those languages or any others into which
you integrate pgTAP tests and I'll update the page.

Oh, and it has a beer. Enjoy.

I think I'll take a little time off from pgTAP next week to
give Bricolage some
much-needed love. But as I'll be given another talk on pgTAP
at PostgreSQL Conference West next month,
worry not! I'll be doing a lot more with pgTAP in the coming weeks.

Oh, and one more thing: I'm looking for consulting work. Give me a shout
(david - at - justatheory.com) if you have some PostgreSQL, Perl, Ruby, MySQL,
or JavaScript hacking you'd like me to do. I'm free through November.

That is all.

title"Pg::Priv Hits CPAN (Thanks Etsy!)
bodyë\Earlier this year, I was working on an administrative utility for
Etsy that validates PostgreSQL database
permissions. Of course, in order to verify that permissions were correct or
needed updating, I had to have a way to examine PostgreSQL ACLs, which are
arrays made of of strings that look like this:

my $acl = [
   'miriam=arwdDxt/miriam',
   '=r/miriam',
   'admin=arw/miriam',
];


So following
the documentation, I wrote a module
that iterates over an ACL, parses each privilege string, and returns an object
describing it. Using it is pretty easy. If you wanted to see what the
permissions looked like on all the tables in a database, you could do it like
so:


#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
use warnings;
use DBI;
use Pg::Priv;

my $dbname = shift or die "Usage: $0 dbname\n";

my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:Pg:dbname=$dbname", 'postgres', '');
my $sth = $dbh->prepare(
    q{SELECT relname, relacl FROM pg_class WHERE relkind = 'r'}
);

$sth->execute;
print "Permissions for $dbname:\n";
while (my $row = $sth->fetchrow_hashref) {
    print "  Table $row->{relname}:\n";
    for my $priv ( Pg::Priv->parse_acl( $row->{relacl} ) ) {
        print '    ', $priv->by, ' granted to ', $priv->to, ': ',
            join( ', ', $priv->labels ), $/;
    }
}


And here's what the output looks like:


Permissions for bric:
  Table media__output_channel:
    postgres granted to postgres: UPDATE, SELECT, INSERT, TRUNCATE, REFERENCE, DELETE, TRIGGER
    postgres granted to bric: UPDATE, SELECT, INSERT, DELETE
  Table media_uri:
    postgres granted to postgres: UPDATE, SELECT, INSERT, TRUNCATE, REFERENCE, DELETE, TRIGGER
    postgres granted to bric: UPDATE, SELECT, INSERT, DELETE
  Table media_fields:
    postgres granted to postgres: UPDATE, SELECT, INSERT, TRUNCATE, REFERENCE, DELETE, TRIGGER


There are a bunch of utility methods to make it pretty simple to examine
PostgreSQL privileges.

And now, I'm pleased to announce the release yesterday of
Pg::Priv. My thanks to Etsy for agreeing to the
release, and particularly to Chad
Dickerson for championing it. This module is a little thing compared to
some things I've seen open-sourced by major players, but even the simplest
utilities can save folks mountains of time. I hope you find Pg::Priv
useful.

titlepgTAP 0.12 Released
bodyá^In anticipation of my PostgreSQL Conference West 2008 talk on Sunday, I've just released pgTAP 0.12. This is a minor release with just a few tweaks:


  Updated plan() to disable warnings while it creates its
    tables. This means that plan() no longer send NOTICE messages
    when they run, although tests still might, depending on the setting of
    client_min_messages.
  Added hasnt_table(), hasnt_view(),
    and hasnt_column().
  Added hasnt_pk(), hasnt_fk(), col_isnt_pk(),
  and col_isnt_fk().
  Added missing DROP statements
    to uninstall_pgtap.sql.in.


I also have an idea to add functions that return the server version number (and each of the version number parts) and an OS string, to make testing things on various versions of PostgreSQL and on various operating systems a lot simpler.

I think I'll also spend some time in the next few weeks on an article explaing exactly what pgTAP is and why you'd want to use it. Provided, of course, I can find the tuits for that.

titlepgTAP 0.22: Test Your Results
bodyÆ5I'm pleased to announce that,
after
much
thinking,
committing,
and not an insignificant amount of
hair-pulling,
pgTAP 0.22 has finally landed. Download it
here. Many, many thanks to all who commented on my
previous posts, made suggestions, and helped me on IRC to figure out how to
get all this stuff to work. The crazy thing is that it does, quite well, all
the way back to PostgreSQL 8.0.

So here's what I've come up with: ten simple functions. Sound like a lot?
Well, it's simpler than it might at first appear. Here's a quick overview:


  results_eq()
  
    Compares two queries row-for-row. Pass in strings with SQL queries,
    strings with prepared statement names, or cursors. If the query you're
    testing returns a single column, the expected results can be passed as an
    array. If a test fails, you get useful diagnostics:

    
# Failed test 146
#     Results differ beginning at row 3:
#         have: (1,Anna)
#         want: (22,Betty)
    

    If a row is missing, the diagnostics will show it as
    a NULL:

    
# Failed test 147
#     Results differ beginning at row 5:
#         have: (1,Anna)
#         want: NULL
    

  

  results_ne()
  
    Just like results_eq(), except that it tests that the
    results of the two arguments are *not* equivalent. May not be very useful,
    but it's cute.
  

  set_eq()
  
    Tests that two queries return the same results, without regard to the
    order of the results or duplicates. Pass in strings with SQL queries or
    strings with prepared statement names. As with results_eq()
    the expected results can be passed as an array if the test query returns a
    single column. Failure diagnostics look like this:

    
# Failed test 146
#     Extra records:
#         (87,Jackson)
#         (1,Jacob)
#     Missing records:
#         (44,Anna)
#         (86,Angelina)
    

    If the failure is due to incompatible column types, the diagnostics
    will help you out there, too:

    
# Failed test 147
#     Columns differ between queries:
#         have: (integer,text)
#         want: (text,integer)
    

  

  set_ne()
  
    The inverse of set_eq(), the test passes if the results of
    the two queries are different, without regard to order or duplicate rows.
    No diagnostics on failure, though; if it fails, it's because the results
    are the same.
  

  set_has()
  
    Tests that a query contains a subset of results without regard to order
    or duplicates. Useful if you need to ensure that a query returns at least some
    set of rows. Failure diagnostics are useful again:

    
# Failed test 122
#     Missing records:
#         (44,Anna)
#         (86,Angelina)
    
  

  set_hasnt()
  
    Tests that a query does not contain a subset of results, without regard to order
      or duplicates.
  

  bag_eq()
  
    Just like set_eq(), except that duplicates matter. So if
    the first query has duplicate rows, the second must have the same
    dupes. Diagnostics are equally useful.
  

  bag_ne()
  
    Just like set_ne(), except that duplicates matter.
  

  bag_has()
  
    Just like set_has(), except that duplicates matter.
  

  bag_hasnt()
  
    Just like set_hasnt(), except that duplicates matter.
  


Be sure to look at my
previous post for usage examples.
Since I wrote it, I've also added the ability to pass an array as the second
argument to these functions. This is specifically for the case when the query
you're testing results a single column of results; the array just makes it
easier to specify expected values in a common case:


SELECT results_eq(
    'SELECT * FROM active_user_ids()',
    ARRAY[ 2, 3, 4, 5]
);


Check the
documentation for all the
details on how to use these functions.

I'm really happy with these functions. It wase definitely worth it to really
think things through, look at
prior art, and spend the time
to try different approaches. In the process, I've found an approach that works
in nearly all circumstances.

The one exception is in results_eq()
and results_ne() on PostgreSQL 8.3 and down. The issue there
is that there were no operators to compare two record
objects before PostgreSQL 8.4. So for earlier versions, the code has to
cast the records representing each row to text. This means
that two rows can be different but appear to be the same to 8.3 and
down. In practice this should be pretty rare, but I'm glad that record
comparisons are more correct in 8.4

The only other issue is performance. Although you can write your tests in
SQL, rather than strings containing SQL, the set and bag functions use the
PL/pgSQL EXECUTE statement to execute each SQL statement and
insert it into a temporary table. Then they select the data from the temporary
tables once or twice to do the comparisons. That's a lot more processing than
simply running the query itself, and it slows down the performance
significantly.

Similarly, the results functions use cursors and fetch each row one-at-a-time.
The nice thing is that, in the event of a failure for results_eq()
or a pass for results_ne(), the functions can stop fetching
results before reaching the end of the quries. But either way, a fair bit of
processing goes on.

I'm not sure which is slower, the set and bag functions or the results
functions, but, short of adding new syntax to SQL (not an option), I could see
no other way to adequately do the comparisons and emit useful diagnostics.

But those are minor caveats, I think. I'm pretty pleased with the function
names and the interfaces I've created for them. Please
download the latest and let me know what you think.

So what's next? Well, there are a few more schema-testing functions I'd
like to add, but after that, I'd like to declare pgTAP stable and start using
it in new projects. I'm thinking about writing a test suite for
database normalization,
starting with testing that all tables
have primary keys.

But that's after my vacation. Back in two weeks.

title%How to Determine Your Transaction ID
bodyÖaToday I had reason to find out what PostgreSQL transaction I was in the middle of at any given moment in Bricolage. Why? I wanted to make sure that a single request was generating multiple transactions, instead of the normal one. It's a long story, but suffice it to say that lengthy transactions were causing deadlocks. Read this if you're really interested.

Anyway, here's how to determine your current transaction using DBI. The query will be the same for any client, of course.


my $sth = $dbh->prepare(qq{
    SELECT transaction
    FROM   pg_locks
    WHERE  pid = pg_backend_pid()
           AND transaction IS NOT NULL
    LIMIT  1
});

$sth->execute;
$sth->bind_columns(\my $txid);
$sth->fetch;
print "Transaction: $txid\n";

titlepgTAP 0.14 Released
bodyåI've just released pgTAP 0.14. This release focues on getting more
schema functions into your hands, as well as fixing a few issues. Changes:


  Added SET search_path statements to uninstall_pgtap.sql.in so that
        it will work properly when TAP is installed in its own schema. Thanks to
        Ben for the catch!
  Added commands to drop pg_version() and pg_version_num()
        touninstall_pgtap.sql.in.
  Added has_index(), index_is_unique(), index_is_primary(),
        is_clustered(), and index_is_type().
  Added os_name(). This is somewhat experimental. If you have uname,
        it's probably correct, but assistance in improving OS detection in the
        Makefile would be greatly appreciated. Notably, it does not detect
        Windows.
  Made ok() smarter when the test result is passed as NULL. It was
        dying, but now it simply fails and attaches a diagnostic message
        reporting that the test result was NULL. Reported by Jason Gordon.
  Fixed an issue in check_test() where an extra character was removed
        from the beginning of the diagnostic output before testing it.
  Fixed a bug comparing name[]s on PostgreSQL 8.2, previously hacked
        around.
  Added has_trigger() and trigger_is().
  Switched to pure SQL implementations of the pg_version() and
        pg_version_num() functions, to simplify including pgTAP in module
        distributions.
  Added a note to README.pgtap about the need to avoid pg_typeof()
        and cmp_ok() in tests run as part of a distribution.


Enjoy!

title4DBIx::Connector and Serializable Snapshot Isolation
body≠bI was at Postgres Open week before last. This was
a great conference, very welcoming atmosphere and lots of great talks. One of
the more significant, for me, was the session on serializable transactions
by Kevin Grittner, who developed SSI for PostgreSQL 9.1. I hadn‚Äôt paid
much attention to this feature before now, but it became clear to me, during
the talk, that it‚Äôs time.

So what is SSI? Well, serializable transactions are almost certainly how you
think of transactions already. Here‚Äôs how Kevin describes them:

True serializable transactions can simplify software development. Because
any transaction which will do the right thing if it is the only transaction
running will also do the right thing in any mix of serializable
transactions, the programmer need not understand and guard against all
possible conflicts. If this feature is used consistently, there is no need
to ever take an explicit lock or SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE.

This is, in fact, generally how I‚Äôve thought about transactions. But I‚Äôve
certainly run into cases where it wasn‚Äôt true. Back in 2006, I wrote an
article on managing many-to-many relationships with PL/pgSQL which
demonstrated a race condition one might commonly find when using an ORM. The
solution I offered was to always use a PL/pgSQL function that does the
work, and that function executes a SELECT...FOR UPDATE statement to overcome
the race condition. This creates a lock that forces conflicting transactions
to be performed serially.

Naturally, this is something one would rather not have to think about. Hence
SSI. When you identify a transaction as serializable, it will be executed
in a truly serializable fashion. So I could actually do away with the
SELECT...FOR UPDATE workaround ‚Äî not to mention any other race conditions I
might have missed ‚Äî simply by telling PostgreSQL to enforce transaction
isolation. This essentially eliminates the possibility of unexpected
side-effects.

This comes at a cost, however. Not in terms of performance so much, since the
SSI implementation uses some fancy, recently-developed algorithms to keep
things efficient. (Kevin tells me via IRC: ‚ÄúUsually the rollback and retry
work is the bulk of the additional cost in an SSI load, in my testing so far.
A synthetic load to really stress the LW locking, with a fully-cached database
doing short read-only transactions will have no serialization failures, but
can run up some CPU time in LW lock contention.‚Äù) No, the cost is actually in
increased chance of transaction rollback. Because SSI will catch more
transaction conflicts than the traditional ‚Äúread committed‚Äù isolation level,
frameworks that expect to work with SSI need to be prepared to handle more
transaction failures. From the fine manual:

The Serializable isolation level provides the strictest transaction
isolation. This level emulates serial transaction execution, as if
transactions had been executed one after another, serially, rather than
concurrently. However, like the Repeatable Read level, applications using
this level must be prepared to retry transactions due to serialization
failures.

And that brings me to DBIx::Connector, my Perl module for safe connection
and transaction management. It currently has no such retry smarts built into
it. The feature closest to that is the ‚Äúfixup‚Äù connection mode, wherein if
a execution of a code block fails due to a connection failure, DBIx::Connector
will re-connect to the database and execute the code reference again.

I think I should extend DBIx::Connector to take isolation failures and
deadlocks into account. That is, fixup mode would retry a code block not
only on connection failure but also on serialization failure (SQLSTATE 40001)
and deadlocks (SQLSTATE 40P01). I would also add a new attribute, retries,
to specify the number of times to retry such execution, with a default of
three (which likely will cover the vast majority of cases). This has actually
been an oft-requested feature, and I‚Äôm glad to have a new reason to add it.

There are a few design issues to overcome, however:


Fixup mode is supported not just by txn(), which scopes the execution of a
code reference to a single transaction, but also run(), which does no
transaction handling. Should the new retry support be added there, too? I
could see it either way (a single SQL statement executed in run() is
implicitly transaction-scoped).
Fixup mode is also supported by svp(), which scopes the execution of a
code reference to a savepoint (a.k.a. a subtransaction). Should the rollback
and retry be supported there, too, or would the whole transaction have to be
retried? I‚Äôm thinking the latter, since that‚Äôs currently the behavior for
connection failures.
Given these issues, will it make more sense to perhaps create a new mode?
Maybe it would be supported only by txn().



This is do-able, will likely just take some experimentation to figure it out
and settle on the appropriate API. I‚Äôll need to find the tuits for that soon.

In the meantime, given currently in-progress changes, I‚Äôve just released a
new version of DBIx::Connector with a single change: All uses of the
deprecated catch syntax now throw warnings. The previous version threw
warnings only the first time the syntax was used in a particular context, to
keep error logs from getting clogged up. Hopefully most folks have changed
their code in the two months since the previous release and switched to
Try::Tiny or some other model for exception handling. The catch syntax
will be completely removed in the next release of DBIx::Connector, likely
around the end of the year. Hopefully the new SSI-aware retry functionality
will have been integrated by then, too.

In a future post I‚Äôll likely chew over whether or not to add an API to set the
transaction isolation level within a call to txn() and friends.

title#Corrected PostgreSQL EAN Functions
body≤%Update: I updated the benchmarks based on the fixed version
of my benchmarking function.

In doing a bit more reading about EAN codes, I realized that my previous attempts to write a validating function
for UPC and EAN codes had a significant error: they would only properly validate
EAN codes if the first numeral was 0! So I went back and fixed them all, and
present them here for posterity.


  
    The substring solution:
    
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ean_substr (
    TEXT
) RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    offset integer := 0;
    -- Support UPCs.
    ean   TEXT    := CASE WHEN length($1) = 12 THEN '0' || $1 ELSE $1 END;
BEGIN
    -- Make sure we really have an EAN.
    IF ean !~ '^\\d{13}$' THEN RETURN FALSE; END IF;

    RETURN 10 - (
        (
          -- Sum even numerals.
            substring(ean,  2 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean,  4 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean,  6 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean,  8 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean, 10 + offset, 1)::integer
          + substring(ean, 12 + offset, 1)::integer
         ) * 3 -- Multiply total by 3.
         -- Add odd numerals except for checksum (13).
         + substring(ean,  1 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(ean,  3 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(ean,  5 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(ean,  7 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(ean,  9 + offset, 1)::integer
         + substring(ean, 11 + offset, 1)::integer
    -- Compare to the checksum.
    ) % 10 = substring(ean, 13 + offset, 1)::integer;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql' immutable;
    
  

  
    The looping solution:
    
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ean_loop(
    TEXT
) RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    total INTEGER := 0;
    -- Support UPCs.
    ean   TEXT    := CASE WHEN length($1) = 12 THEN '0' || $1 ELSE $1 END;
BEGIN
    -- Make sure we really have an EAN.
    IF ean !~ '^\\d{13}$' THEN RETURN FALSE; END IF;

    -- Sum even numerals.
    FOR i IN 2..12 LOOP
        total := total + substring(ean, i, 1)::INTEGER;
        i := i + 1;
    END LOOP;

    -- Multiply total by 3.
    total := total * 3;

    -- Add odd numerals except for checksum (13).
    FOR i IN 1..11 LOOP
        total := total + substring(ean, i, 1)::INTEGER;
        i := i + 1;
    END LOOP;

    -- Compare to the checksum.
    RETURN 10 - total % 10 = substring(ean, 13, 1)::INTEGER;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql' immutable;
    
  

  
    The BYTEA solution:
    
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ean_byte (
   arg TEXT
) RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    -- Convert to BYTEA; support UPCs.
    ean BYTEA := CASE WHEN length($1) = 12 THEN '0' || $1 ELSE $1 END;
BEGIN
    -- Make sure we really have an EAN.
    IF arg !~ '^\\d{12,13}$' THEN RETURN FALSE; END IF;

    RETURN 10 - (
        (
            -- Sum odd numerals.
            get_byte(ean,  1) - 48
          + get_byte(ean,  3) - 48
          + get_byte(ean,  5) - 48
          + get_byte(ean,  7) - 48
          + get_byte(ean,  9) - 48
          + get_byte(ean, 11) - 48
         ) * 3 -- Multiply total by 3.
         -- Add even numerals except for checksum (12).
         + get_byte(ean,  0) - 48
         + get_byte(ean,  2) - 48
         + get_byte(ean,  4) - 48
         + get_byte(ean,  6) - 48
         + get_byte(ean,  8) - 48
         + get_byte(ean, 10) - 48
    -- Compare to the checksum.
    ) % 10 = get_byte(ean, 12) - 48;
    
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql immutable;
    
  

  
    The PL/Perl solution:
    
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ean_perl (
    TEXT
) RETURNS boolean AS $_$
    my $ean = length $_[0] == 12 ? "0$_[0]" : $_[0];
    # Make sure we really have an EAN.
    return 'false' unless $ean =~ /^\d{13}$/;
    my @nums = split '', $ean;
    return 10 - (
        # Sum even numerals.
        (   (   $nums[1] + $nums[3] + $nums[5] + $nums[7] + $nums[9]
                    + $nums[11]
            ) * 3 # Multiply total by 3.
        # Add odd numerals except for checksum (12).
        ) + $nums[0] + $nums[2] + $nums[4] + $nums[6] + $nums[8] + $nums[10]
    # Compare to the checksum.
    ) % 10 == $nums[12] ? 'true' : 'false';
$_$ LANGUAGE plperl immutable;
    
  

  
    The C solution (thanks StuckMojo!):
    
#include <string.h>
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"

Datum ean_c(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS);

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(ean_c);

Datum ean_c(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS) {

    char *ean;
    text *arg = PG_GETARG_TEXT_P(0);
    int  arglen = VARSIZE(arg) - VARHDRSZ;
    bool ret = false;

    /* Validate the easy stuff: 12 or 13 digits. */
    if ((arglen != 12 && arglen != 13) || 
        strspn(VARDATA(arg), "0123456789") != arglen) {
        PG_RETURN_BOOL(ret);
    }

    /* Support UPCs. */
    if (arglen == 12) {
        ean = (char *) palloc(13);
        ean[0] = '0';
        memcpy(&ean[1], VARDATA(arg), arglen);
    } else {
        ean = (char *) palloc(arglen);
        memcpy(ean, VARDATA(arg), arglen);
    }

    ret = 10 - (
            /* Sum even numerals and multiply total by 3. */
            (  ean[1] - '0' + ean[3] - '0' + ean[5]  - '0' 
             + ean[7] - '0' + ean[9] - '0' + ean[11] - '0') * 3

        ) % 10 == ean[12] - '0';

   PG_RETURN_BOOL(ret);
}

titleWhy Test Databases?
bodyòI‚Äôm going to be doing some presentations on testing for database
administrators. I‚Äôve been really excited to be working
on pgTAP, and have started
using it extensively to write tests for a client with a bunch of PostgreSQL
databases. But as I start to push the idea of testing within the PostgreSQL
community, I‚Äôm running into some surprising resistance.

I asked a major figure in the community about this, someone who has
expressed skepticism in my past presentations. He feels that it‚Äôs hard to
create a generic testing framework. He told me:


  Well, you are testing for bugs, and bugs are pretty specific in where
they appear. Writing the tests is 90% of the job; writing the infrastructure
is minor. If the infrastructure has limitations, which all do, you might as
well write that extra 10% too.


I have to say that this rather surprised me. I guess I just thought that
everyone was on board with the idea of testing. The PostgreSQL core,
after all, has a test suite. But the idea that one writes test to test for
bugs seems like a major misconception about testing: I don‚Äôt write tests to
test bugs (that is what regression tests are for, but there is much
more to testing than regression tests); I write tests to ensure consistent and
correct behavior in my code as development continues over time.

It has become clear to me that I need to reframe my database testing
presentations to emphasize not the how to go about testing; I think
that pgTAP does a pretty good job of making it a straight-forward process (at
least as straight-forward as when writing tests in Ruby or Perl, for example).
What I have to address first is the why of testing. I need to convince
database administrators that testing is an essential tool in their kits, and the
way to do that is to show them why it‚Äôs essential.

With this in mind, I
asked, via Twitter,
why should database people test their databases? I got some great answers
(and, frankly, the 140 character limit of Twitter made them admirably pithy, which
is a huge help):


  chromatic_x: @theory, because accidents that happen during tests are much easier to recover from than accidents that happen live.
  caseywest: @Theory When you write code that‚Äôs testable you tend to write better code: cleaner interfaces, reusable components, composable pieces.
  depesz_com: @Theory testing prevents repeating mistakes.
  rjbs: @Theory The best ROI for me is ‚Äúnever ship the same bug twice.‚Äù
  elein: @Theory trust but verify
  cwinters: @Theory so they can change the system without feeling like they‚Äôre on a suicide mission
  caseywest: @Theory So they can document how the system actually works.
  hanekomu: @Theory Regression tests - to see whether, after having changed something here, something else over there falls over.
  robrwo: @Theory Show them a case where bad data is inserted into/deleted from database because constraints weren‚Äôt set up.


Terrific ideas there. I thank you, Tweeps. But I ask here, too: Why should we write tests against our databases? Leave a comment with your (brief!) thoughts.

And thank you!

title+Fixing Foreign Key Deadlocks in PostgreSQL
bodyé}PGX had a client come to us recently with a rather nasty deadlock issue. It took far longer than we would have liked to figure out the issue, and once we did, they were able to clear it up by dropping an unnecessary index. Still, it shouldn‚Äôt have been happening to begin with. Joel Jacobson admirably explained the issue on pgsql-hackers (and don‚Äôt miss the screencast).

Some might consider it a bug in PostgreSQL, but the truth is that PostgreSQL can obtain stronger than necessary locks. Such locks cause some operations to block unnecessarily and some other operations to deadlock, especially when foreign keys are used in a busy database. And really, who doesn‚Äôt use FKs in their busy database?

Fortunately, Simon Riggs proposed a solution. And it‚Äôs a good one. So good that PGX is partnering with Glue Finance and Command Prompt as founding sponsors on a new FOSSExperts project to actually get it done. √Ålvaro Herrera is doing the actual hacking on the project, and has already blogged about it here and here.

If you use foreign key constraints (and you should!) and you have a high transaction load on your database (or expect to soon!), this matters to you. In fact, if you use ActiveRecord with Rails, there might even be a special place in your heart for this issue, says Mina Naguib. We‚Äôd really like to get this done in time for the PostgreSQL 9.1 release. But it will only happen if the project can be funded.

Yes, that‚Äôs right, as with PGXN, this is community project for which we‚Äôre raising funds from the community to get it done. I think that more and more work could be done this way, as various interested parties contribute small amounts to collectively fund improvements to the benefit of us all. So can you help out? Hit the FOSSExperts project page for all the project details, and to make your contribution.

Help us help the community to make PostgreSQL better than ever!

titlePGAN Bikeshedding
bodyéI‚Äôve put together a description of PGAN, the PostgreSQL extension distribution system I plan to develop later this year based on the Comprehensive Archive Perl Network or CPAN. Its primary features will be:


Extension distribution
Search site with extension documentation
Client for downloading, building, testing, and installing extensions.


I‚Äôve never been thrilled with the name, though, so I‚Äôm asking for suggestions for a better one. I‚Äôve used the term "extension" here because it seems to be the term that the PostgreSQL community has settled on, but other terms might work, since things other than extensions might be distributed.

What I‚Äôve come up with so far is:


  
    Name
    Long Name
    Pronounciation
    Advantages
    Disadvantages
  
  
    PGAN
    PostgreSQL Add-on Network
    pee-gan
    Short, similar to CPAN
    Ugly
  
  
    PGEX
    PostgreSQL Extensions
    pee-gee-ex or pee-gex
    Short, easier to pronounce
    Too similar to PGX)
  
  
    PGCAN
    PostgreSQL Comprehensive Archive Network
    pee-gee-can
    Similar to CPAN
    Similar to CPAN
  
  
    PGDAN
    PostgreSQL Distribution Archive Network
    pee-gee-dan
    Short, easy to pronounce
    Who‚Äôs ‚ÄúDan‚Äù? Doesn‚Äôt distribute PostgreSQL itself.
  
  
    PGEDAN
    PostgreSQL Extension Distribution Archive Network
    pee-gee-ee-dan
    References extensions
    Long, sounds stupid
  


Of these, I think I like ‚ÄúPGEX‚Äù best, but none are really great. So I‚Äôm opening up the bike shed to all. What‚Äôs a better name? Or if you can‚Äôt think of one, which of the above do you like best? Just leave a comment on this post. The only requirements for suggestions are that a .org domain be available and that it suck less than the alternatives.

Comments close in 2 weeks. Thanks!

title1How to Generate Recurring Events in the Database
bodyÛWThis is a followup to
my request for help fixing the
performance of a database view that generated recurrences for events. This was
an essential feature of Sandy, and thus important to get right. The idea
when I started was simple:


  Add a recurrence domain to the database that supports a
  number of different values, including daily, weekly,
  and monthly.
  Add a recurrence column to the events table
  that identify how an event recurs.
  Add a recurrence_dates table that contains a pre-generated
  list of recurrences for a given date. I'd populated this table with five
  years of dates, each one mapped to five years worth of recurrence dates (see
  the originalblog entry for more on the
  format of this table.
  Create a view that maps each events row to its date and
  recurrence in the recurrence_dates table.
  Profit.


It was this last bullet point that didn't quite work out: although the data
was perfectly accurate, queries for a lot of events in the view were
very expensive. I mean, the query could run for 3-4 minutes. It was
just crazy! I couldn't figure out the problem, so I posted my request for help. It was
through discussions that followed with depesz that I finally figured out what the
problem was: Although I was usually selecting only a week's or months worth of
events, the view was calculating rows for all five years worth of data for all
of the events for a given user. Um, not efficient.

So here I finally document how, with a lot of help and example code from
depesz, I solved the problem. The trick was to use a function instead of a
view to generate the recurring event rows, and to limit it only to the dates
we're interested in. For convenience sake, I broke this down into two PL/pgSQL
functions: one to generate recurring dates and one to return the recurring
event rows. But first, here's the recurrence domain and the
events table, both of which are unchanged from the original
approach:


CREATE DOMAIN recurrence AS TEXT
CHECK ( VALUE IN ( 'none', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly' ) );

CREATE TABLE events (
    id         SERIAL     PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id    INTEGER    NOT NULL,
    starts_at  TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL,
    start_tz   TEXT       NOT NULL,
    ends_at    TIMESTAMP,
    end_tz     TEXT       NOT NULL,
    recurrence RECURRENCE NOT NULL DEFAULT 'none'
);


Just assume the user_id is a foreign key. Now let's populate
this table with some data. For the purposes of this demonstration, I'm going
to create one event per day for 1000 days, evenly divided between daily,
weekly, monthly, and no recurrences, as well as five different times of day
and six different durations:


INSERT INTO events (user_id, starts_at, start_tz, ends_at, end_tz, recurrence)
SELECT 1,
       ts::timestamp,
       'PST8PDT',
       ts::timestamp + dur::interval,
       'PST8PDT',
       recur
  FROM (
    SELECT '2007-12-19'::date + i || ' ' || CASE i % 5
               WHEN 0 THEN '06:00'
               WHEN 1 THEN '10:00'
               WHEN 2 THEN '14:00'
               WHEN 3 THEN '18:00'
               ELSE        '22:30'
               END,
           CASE i % 6
               WHEN 0 THEN '2 hours'
               WHEN 1 THEN '1 hour'
               WHEN 2 THEN '45 minutes'
               WHEN 3 THEN '3.5 hours'
               WHEN 4 THEN '15 minutes'
               ELSE        '30 minutes'
               END,
           CASE i % 4
               WHEN 0 THEN 'daily'
               WHEN 1 THEN 'weekly'
               WHEN 2 THEN 'monthly'
               ELSE        'none'
               END
    FROM generate_series(1, 1000) as gen(i)
  ) AS ser( ts, dur, recur);


This gives us some nicely distributed data:


try=# select * from events limit 10;
  id  | user_id |      starts_at      | start_tz |       ends_at       | end_tz  | recurrence 
------+---------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------+------------
    1 |       1 | 2007-12-20 10:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-20 11:00:00 | PST8PDT | weekly
    2 |       1 | 2007-12-21 14:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-21 14:45:00 | PST8PDT | monthly

    6 |       1 | 2007-12-25 10:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-25 12:00:00 | PST8PDT | monthly
    7 |       1 | 2007-12-26 14:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-26 15:00:00 | PST8PDT | none
    8 |       1 | 2007-12-27 18:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-27 18:45:00 | PST8PDT | daily
    9 |       1 | 2007-12-28 22:30:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-29 02:00:00 | PST8PDT | weekly

(10 rows)


Now let's get to the recurring date function:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION  generate_recurrences(
    recurs RECURRENCE, 
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE
)
    RETURNS setof DATE
    LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE
    AS $BODY$
DECLARE
    next_date DATE := start_date;
    duration  INTERVAL;
    day       INTERVAL;
    check     TEXT;
BEGIN
    IF recurs = 'none' THEN
        -- Only one date ever.
        RETURN next next_date;
    ELSIF recurs = 'weekly' THEN
        duration := '7 days'::interval;
        WHILE next_date <= end_date LOOP
            RETURN NEXT next_date;
            next_date := next_date + duration;
        END LOOP;
    ELSIF recurs = 'daily' THEN
        duration := '1 day'::interval;
        WHILE next_date <= end_date LOOP
            RETURN NEXT next_date;
            next_date := next_date + duration;
        END LOOP;
    ELSIF recurs = 'monthly' THEN
        duration := '27 days'::interval;
        day      := '1 day'::interval;
        check    := to_char(start_date, 'DD');
        WHILE next_date <= end_date LOOP
            RETURN NEXT next_date;
            next_date := next_date + duration;
            WHILE to_char(next_date, 'DD') <> check LOOP
                next_date := next_date + day;
            END LOOP;
        END LOOP;
    ELSE
        -- Someone needs to update this function, methinks.
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Recurrence % not supported by generate_recurrences()', recurs;
    END IF;
END;
$BODY$;


The idea here is pretty simple: pass in a recurrence (daily,
weekly, or monthly), a start date, and an end date, and get
back a set of all the recurrence dates between the start and end dates:


try=# \timing
Timing is on.
try=# select * from  generate_recurrences('daily', '2008-01-29', '2008-02-05');

Not bad, eh? And PostgreSQL's date and interval calculation operators are
wicked fast. Check out how long it dates to generate
two years worth of daily recurrence dates:


try=# select * from  generate_recurrences('daily', '2008-01-29', '2010-02-05');
 generate_recurrences 
----------------------
 2008-01-29
 2008-01-30
 2008-01-31
...
 2010-02-03
 2010-02-04
 2010-02-05
(739 rows)

Time: 4.982 ms


Awesome. And the great thing about this function is that any time I need to
add new recurrences (yearly, biweekly, quarterly, weekends, weekdays, etc.), I
just modify the domain and this function and we're ready to go.

And now, part two: the recurring event function:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recurring_events_for(
   for_user_id INTEGER,
   range_start TIMESTAMP,
   range_end   TIMESTAMP
)
   RETURNS SETOF events
   LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE
   AS $BODY$
DECLARE
   event events;
   start_date TIMESTAMPTZ;
   start_time TEXT;
   ends_at    TIMESTAMPTZ;
   next_date  DATE;
   recurs_at  TIMESTAMPTZ;
BEGIN
   FOR event IN 
       SELECT *
         FROM events
        WHERE user_id = for_user_id
          AND (
                  recurrence <> 'none'
              OR  (
                     recurrence = 'none'
                 AND starts_at BETWEEN range_start AND range_end
              )
          )
    LOOP
       IF event.recurrence = 'none' THEN
         RETURN NEXT event;
         CONTINUE;
       END IF;

       start_date := event.starts_at::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE event.start_tz;
       start_time := start_date::time::text;
       ends_at    := event.ends_at::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE event.end_tz;

       FOR next_date IN
           SELECT *
             FROM generate_recurrences(
                      event.recurrence,
                      start_date::date,
                      (range_end AT TIME ZONE event.start_tz)::date
             )
       LOOP
           recurs_at := (next_date || ' ' || start_time)::timestamp
               AT TIME ZONE event.start_tz;
           EXIT WHEN recurs_at > range_end;
           CONTINUE WHEN recurs_at < range_start AND ends_at < range_start;
           event.starts_at := recurs_at;
           event.ends_at   := ends_at;
           RETURN NEXT event;
       END LOOP;
   END LOOP;
   RETURN;
END;
$BODY$;


The idea here is to select the appropriate events for a given user between
two dates, and for each event iterate over all of the recurrences between the
two dates and return a row for each one. So the lines starting with FOR
event IN and ending with LOOP select the original events,
looking for either recurring events or non-recurring events that are between
the two dates. Note that if you needed to, you could easily refine this query
for your particular application, or even use
PL/pgSQL's EXECUTE
operator to dynamically generate queries to suit particular application
needs.

Next, the block starting with IF event.recurrence =
'none' THEN simply returns any non-recurring events.
Although the next block already handles this case, adding this optimization
eliminates a fair bit of calculation for the common case of non-recurring
events.

Then the lines starting with FOR next_date IN and ending with
LOOP select all of the dates for the recurrence in question,
using the generate_recurrences() function created earlier. From
LOOP to END LOOP;, the function generates the start
and end timestamps, exiting the loop when the start date falls after the range
or when it falls before the range and the end date falls after the range.
There are many other tweaks one could make here to modify which recurrences
are included and which are excluded. For example, if you had a column in the
events table such as exclude_dates TIMESTAMP[] NOT NULL
DEFAULT '{}' that stored an array of dates to ignore when generating
recurrences, you could just add this line to go ahead and exclude them from
the results returned by the function:


           CONTINUE WHEN recurs_at = ANY( exclude_dates );


But enough of the details: let's see how it works! Here's a query for a
week's worth of data:


try=# select * from recurring_events_for(1, '2007-12-19', '2007-12-26');
  id  | user_id |      starts_at      | start_tz |       ends_at       | end_tz  | recurrence 
------+---------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------+------------
    1 |       1 | 2007-12-20 10:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-20 03:00:00 | PST8PDT | weekly
    2 |       1 | 2007-12-21 14:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-21 06:45:00 | PST8PDT | monthly
    3 |       1 | 2007-12-22 18:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-22 21:30:00 | PST8PDT | none
    4 |       1 | 2007-12-23 22:30:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-23 14:45:00 | PST8PDT | daily
    4 |       1 | 2007-12-24 22:30:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-23 14:45:00 | PST8PDT | daily
    4 |       1 | 2007-12-25 22:30:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-23 14:45:00 | PST8PDT | daily
    5 |       1 | 2007-12-24 06:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-23 22:30:00 | PST8PDT | weekly
    6 |       1 | 2007-12-25 10:00:00 | PST8PDT  | 2007-12-25 04:00:00 | PST8PDT | monthly
(8 rows)

Time: 51.890 ms


Note the time it took to execute this query. 52 ms is a hell of a
lot faster than the several minutes it took to run a similar query using the
old view. Plus, I'm not limited to just the recurrence dates I've
pre-calculated in the old recurrence_dates table. Now we can use
whatever dates are supported by PostgreSQL. It's even fast when we look at a
year's worth of data:


try=# select * from recurring_events_for(1, '2007-12-19', '2008-12-19');
  id  | user_id |      starts_at      | start_tz |       ends_at       | end_tz  | recurrence

Not stellar, but still respectable. Given that for a typical application, a
user will be looking at only a day's or a week's or a month's events at a time,
this seems to be an acceptable trade-off. I mean, how often will your users
need to see a list of 20,000 events? And even if a user waslooking at
a year's worth of data, it's unlikely that 75% of them would be recurring as
in the example data here.

I was fucking pumped with this solution, and Sandy has hummed
along nicely since we put it into production. If you're interested in trying
it for yourself, I've you can get all the SQL from this blog entry here.

The only thing I would like to have been able to do differently was to
encapsulate the recurring_events_for() function in a view. Such
would have made it much easier to actually use this solution in
Rails. If you know how to do that, please do leave a comment. As for how I
hacked Rails to use the function, well, that's a blog post for another
day.

title%Quest for PostgreSQL Project Hosting
bodyó_The pgTAP project is currently hosted by pgFoundry. This is an old version of GForge, and from what I understand, highly modified for the PostgreSQL project. That‚Äôs fine, except that it apparently makes it impossible for anyone to find the tuits to upgrade it to newer versions.

And it needs upgrading. One annoying thing I noticed is that the URLs for release files include an integer in them. For example, the URL to download pgTAP 0.23 is http://pgfoundry.org/frs/download.php/2511/pgtap-0.23.tar.bz2. See the ‚Äú25111‚Äù there? It appears to be a primary key value or something, but is completely irrelevant for a release URL. I would much prefer that the URL be something like http://pgfoundry.org/frs/download.php/pgtap-0.23.tar.bz2 or, even better, http://pgfoundry.org/projects/pgtap/frs/pgtap-0.23.tar.bz2. But such is not the case now.

Another issue is hosting. I've registered pgtap.org to use for hosting the pgTAP Web site, but there is no support for pointing a hostname at a pgFoundry/GForge site.

These issues could of course be worked out if someone had the tuits to take them on, but apparently there is no one. So I'm looking to move.

The question is, where to? I could get a paid GitHub account (the pgTAP source is already on GitHub) and be able to have a pgTAP site on pgtap.org from there, so that‚Äôs a plus. And I can do file releases, too, in which case the URL format would be something like http://cloud.github.com/downloads/theory/pgtap/pgtap-0.23.tar.bz2, which isn‚Äôt ideal, but is a hell of a lot better than a URL with a sequence number in it. I could put them on the hosted site, too, in which case they'd have whatever URL I wanted them to have.

There are only two downsides I can think of to moving to GitHub:


No mail list support. The pgTAP mail list has next to no traffic so far, so I'm not sure this is a big deal. I could also set up a list elsewhere, like Librelist, if I really needed one. I'd prefer to have @pgtap.org mail lists, but it‚Äôs not a big deal.
I would lose whatever community presence I gain from hosting on pgFoundry. I know that when I release a Perl module to CPAN that it will be visible to lots of people in the Perl community, and automatically searchable via search.cpan.org and other tools. A CPAN release is a release to the Perl community.

There is nothing like this for PostgreSQL. pgFoundry is the closest thing, and, frankly, nowhere near as good (pgFoundry‚Äôs search rankings have always stunk). So if I were to remove my projects from pgFoundry, how could I make them visible to the community? Is there any other central repository of or searchable list of third-party PostgreSQL offerings?


So I'm looking for advice. Does having an email list matter? If I can get pgTAP announcements included in the PostgreSQL Weekly News, is that enough community visibility? Do you know of a nice project hosting site that offers hosting, mail lists, download mirroring and custom domain handling?

I'll follow up with a summary of what I've found in a later post.

titleBHow to Ensure Unique Values Relative to a Column in Another Table
bodyØXI recently came across a need to ensure that the value of a column in one table is unique relative to the value of a column in another table. This came about through my use of views to represent object-oriented inheritance relationships in PostgreSQL. For example, say I have a parent class, Person, and its subclass, User. The person table is quite straight-forward:


CREATE TABLE person (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY SERIAL,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name  TEXT,
  state      INTEGER
);


I use a combination of a table and a view to represent the User class while keeping all of the data nicely denormalized:


CREATE TABLE person_usr (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES person (id),
    username TEXT,
    password TEXT
);

CREATE VIEW usr AS
SELECT p.id AS id, p.first_name AS first_name, p.last_name AS last_name,
       p.state AS state, u.username AS username, u.password AS password
FROM   person p, usr u
WHERE  p.id = u.id;


So to maintain things, I write rules on the usr view to execute INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE queries against the person and person_usr tables as appropriate.

Now, say that I have a business requirement to allow there to be duplicate usernames for users provided that only one is not deleted. Whether a user object is active, inactive, or deleted is determined by the value in its state attribute, which is stored in the person table. The value of the state attribute can be 1 for active, 0 for inactive, and -1 for deleted. So how can I ensure, in the database, that this rule is followed?

Well, if the state and username columns were in a single table, this is very easy in PostgreSQL: just create a partial unique index:


CREATE UNIQUE INDEX udx_usr_unique
ON usr(username)
WHERE state > -1;


This does the trick beautifully, and is nice and compact. However, my OO design has the User class inheriting from Person, so I have the username column in one table and the state column in another. At first, I thought that I could stil use a partial unique index, something like this:


CREATE UNIQUE INDEX udx_usr_unique
ON usr(username)
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM person WHERE state > -1);


Unfortunately, as of PostgreSQL 8.1, the PostgreSQL documentation states:


The expression used in the WHERE clause may refer only to columns of the underlying table, but it can use all columns, not just the ones being indexed. Presently, subqueries and aggregate expressions are also forbidden in WHERE. The same restrictions apply to index fields that are expressions.


D'oh!

So I had to figure out another method. CHECK constraints cannot reference another table, either. So I was left with triggers. It's ugly and verbose, but it appears to do the trick. Here is the recipe:


CREATE FUNCTION cki_usr_username_unique() RETURNS trigger AS '
  BEGIN
    /* Lock the relevant records in the parent and child tables. */
    PERFORM true
    FROM    person_usr, person
    WHERE   person_usr.id = person.id AND username = NEW.username FOR UPDATE;
    IF (SELECT true
        FROM   usr
        WHERE  id <> NEW.id AND username = NEW.username AND usr.state > -1
        LIMIT 1
    ) THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION ''duplicate key violates unique constraint "ck_person_usr_username_unique"'';
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
' LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER cki_usr_username_unique BEFORE INSERT ON person_usr
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE cki_usr_username_unique();

CREATE FUNCTION cku_usr_username_unique() RETURNS trigger AS '
  BEGIN
    IF (NEW.username <> OLD.username) THEN
        /* Lock the relevant records in the parent and child tables. */
        PERFORM true
        FROM    person_usr, person
        WHERE   person_usr.id = person.id AND username = NEW.username FOR UPDATE;
        IF (SELECT true
            FROM   usr
            WHERE  id <> NEW.id AND username = NEW.username AND usr.state > -1
            LIMIT 1
        ) THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION ''duplicate key violates unique constraint "ck_person_usr_username_unique"'';
        END IF;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
' LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER cku_usr_username_unique BEFORE UPDATE ON person_usr
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE cku_usr_username_unique();

CREATE FUNCTION ckp_usr_username_unique() RETURNS trigger AS '
  BEGIN
    IF (NEW.state > -1 AND OLD.state < 0
        AND (SELECT true FROM person_usr WHERE id = NEW.id)
       ) THEN
        /* Lock the relevant records in the parent and child tables. */
        PERFORM true
        FROM    person_usr, person
        WHERE   person_usr.id = person.id
                AND username = (SELECT username FROM person_usr WHERE id = NEW.id)
        FOR UPDATE;

        IF (SELECT COUNT(username)
            FROM   person_usr
            WHERE username = (SELECT username FROM person_usr WHERE id = NEW.id)
        ) > 1 THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION ''duplicate key violates unique constraint "ck_person_usr_username_unique"'';
        END IF;
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
  END;
' LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER ckp_usr_username_unique BEFORE UPDATE ON person
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE ckp_usr_username_unique();

 
Why am I locking rows? To prevent some other transaction from changing another row to create username conflicts. For example, while I might be changing a username to foo for one record, an existing record with that username but its state set to -1 might be getting activated in a separate transaction. So gotta try to prevent that. Josh Berkus pointed out that issue in an earlier iteration of the triggers.

Anyway, am I on crack here? Isn't there a simpler way to do this sort of thing? And if not, have I really got the race conditions all eliminated with the row locks?

Update: In further testing, I discovered that the SELECT ... FOR UPDATE was failing on views with the error ERROR:  no relation entry for relid 7. I have no idea what that means, but I found that it didn't happen when I selected against the tables directly. So I've updated the functions above to reflect that change. I've also fixed a few pastos as pointed out in the comments.category"Computers | Databases | PostgreSQL	timestamp

titleUnicode Normalization in SQL
bodyß I've been peripherally aware of the need for unicode normalization in my
code for a while, but only got around to looking into it today. Although I
use Encode to convert text inputs into Perl's internal form and UTF-8 or
an appropriate encoding in all my outputs, it does nothing about
normalization.

What's normalization you ask?

Well, UTF-8 allows some characters to be encoded in different ways. For
example, √© can be written as either ‚Äú&#x00e9;‚Äù, which is a ‚Äúprecomposed
character,‚Äù or as ‚Äú&#x0065;&#x0301;‚Äù, which is a combination of
‚Äúe‚Äù and ‚ÄúÃÅ‚Äù. This is all well and good, but the trouble comes
when you want to compare values. Observe this Perl one-liner:


% perl -le 'print "\x{00e9}" eq "\x{0065}\x{0301}" ? "t" : "f"'
f


The same issue exists in your database. Here's an example from
PostgreSQL:


try=# select U&'\00E9' = U&'\0065\0301';
 ?column? 
----------
 f
(1 row)


If you have a user enter data in your Web app using combining characters,
and then another does a search with canonical characters, the search will
fail. This won't do at all.

The solution is to
normalize your Unicode data. In Perl, you can use
Unicode::Normalize, a C/XS module that
uses Perl's internal unicode tables to convert things as appropriate. For
general use the NFC normalization
is probably
best:


use Unicode::Normalize;
$string = NFC $string;


PostgreSQL offers no normalization routines. However, the SQL standard
mandates one (as of SQL 2008, at least). It looks like this:


<normalize function> ::= NORMALIZE <left paren> <character value expression> [ <comma> <normal form> [ <comma> <normalize function result length> ] ] <right paren>
<normal form> ::= NFC | NFD | NFKC | NFKD


The second argument defaults to NFC and the third, which
specifies a maximum length of the return value, is optional. The fact that it
looks like a function means that we can use PL/PerlU to emulate it in
PostgreSQL until a proper implementation makes it into core. Here's how:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION NORMALIZE(
    string TEXT,
    form   TEXT,
    maxlen INT
) RETURNS TEXT LANGUAGE plperlu AS $$
    use Unicode::Normalize 'normalize';
    my ($string, $form, $maxlen) = @_;
    my $ret = normalize($form, $string);
    elog(ERROR, 'Normalized value is too long') if length $ret > $maxlen;
    return $ret;
$$;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION NORMALIZE(
    string TEXT,
    form   TEXT
) RETURNS TEXT LANGUAGE plperlu AS $$
    use Unicode::Normalize 'normalize';
    return normalize($_[1], $_[0]);
$$;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION NORMALIZE(
    string TEXT
) RETURNS TEXT LANGUAGE plperlu AS $$
    use Unicode::Normalize 'normalize';
    return normalize('NFC', shift);
$$;


I wrote a few tests to make sure it was sane:


SELECT U&'\0065\0301' as combined,
       char_length(U&'\0065\0301'),
       NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301') as normalized,
       char_length(NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301'));

SELECT NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301', 'NFC')  AS NFC,
       NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301', 'NFD')  AS NFD,
       NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301', 'NFKC') AS NFKC,
       NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301', 'NFKD') AS NFKD
;

SELECT NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301', 'NFC', 1)  AS NFC,
       NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301', 'NFD', 2)  AS NFD,
       NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301', 'NFKC', 1) AS NFKC,
       NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301', 'NFKD', 2) AS NFKD;

SELECT NORMALIZE(U&'\0065\0301', 'NFD', 1);


And the output


 combined | char_length | normalized | char_length 
----------+-------------+------------+-------------
 √©        |           2 | √©          |           1
(1 row)

 nfc | nfd | nfkc | nfkd 
-----+-----+------+------
 √©   | √©   | √©    | √©
(1 row)

 nfc | nfd | nfkc | nfkd 
-----+-----+------+------
 √©   | √©   | √©    | √©
(1 row)

psql:try.sql:45: ERROR:  error from Perl function "normalize": Normalized value is too long at line 5.


Cool! So that's fairly close to the standard. The main difference is that
the form argument must be a string instead of a constant literal. But
PostgreSQL would likely support both. The length argument is also a literal,
and can be 10 charcters or 64 bytes, but for our
purposes, this is fine. The only downside to it is that it's slow: PostgreSQL
must convert its text value to a Perl string to pass to the function, and then
Unicode::Normalize turns it into a C string again to do the conversion, then
back to a Perl string which, in turn, is returned to PostgreSQL and converted
back into the text form. Not the quickest process, but may prove useful
anyway.

Update: 1 Hour Later

Note that this issue applies when
using full text search, too.
Alas, it does not normalize unicode charaters for you:


try=# select to_tsvector(U&'\00E9clair') @@ to_tsquery(U&'\0065\0301clair');
 ?column? 
----------
 f
(1 row)


But normalizing with the functions I introduced does work:


try=# select to_tsvector(U&'\00E9clair') @@ to_tsquery(normalize(U&'\0065\0301clair'));
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)


So yes, this really can be an issue in your applications.

titleRails Migrations with Slony?
bodyâThe new app I'm developing is written in Ruby on Rails and runs on PostgreSQL. We're replicating our production database using Slony-I, but we've run into a bit of a snag: database schema updates must be run as plain SQL through a Slony script in order to ensure proper replication of the schema changes within a transaction, but Rails migrations run as Ruby code updating the database via the Rails database adapter.

So how do others handle Rails migrations with their Slony-I replication setups? How do you update the Slony-I configuration file for the changes? How do you synchronize changes to the master schema out to the slaves? Do you shut down your apps, shut down Slony-I, make the schema changes to both the master and the slaves, and then restart Slony-I and your apps?

For that matter, people running Slony for their Bricolage databases must have the same issue, because the Bricolage upgrade scripts are just Perl using the DBI, not SQL files. Can anyone shed a little light on this for me?

Oh, and one last question: Why is this such a PITA? Can't we have decent replication that replicates everything, including schema changes? Please?category"Computers | Databases | PostgreSQL	timestamp

titleHigher Order PL/pgSQL
body©qWell, it's not really higher order PL/pgSQL, since the language
doesn't
support closures, as far as I know.
But I have been working on a series of articles
for O'Reilly Databases site, drawing
inspiration from Mark Jason Dominus's
Higher-Order Perl, and specifically
using the Fibonacci sequence to create example PL/pgSQL functions. It turns
out that, while the Fibonacci sequence may not be of much use in day-to-day
database work, it makes for great pedagogy. And I learned a fair bit along the
way, as well.

So the initial, na√Øve implementation of a Fibonacci calculate in PL/pgSQL,
using recursion, is quite straight-forward:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib (
    fib_for int
) RETURNS integer AS $$
BEGIN
    IF fib_for < 2 THEN
        RETURN fib_for;
    END IF;
    RETURN fib(fib_for - 2) + fib(fib_for - 1);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


Pretty simple, right? The $$, by the way, is PL/pgSQL
dollar-quoting, which prevents me from having to escape single quotes in the
function body (when the function body has them, that is!). of course, this is
as slow in PL/pgSQL as it would be in any other language:


try=% explain analyze select fib(26);
----------------------------
 Total runtime: 3772.315 ms


Pretty sad, right? So then I added memoization. In PL/pgSQL, this is as
simple as using a table for the cache:


CREATE TABLE fib_cache (
     num integer PRIMARY KEY,
     fib integer NOT NULL
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib_cached(
    fib_for int
) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    ret integer;
BEGIN
    if fib_for < 2 THEN
        RETURN fib_for;
    END IF;

    SELECT INTO ret fib
    FROM   fib_cache
    WHERE  num = fib_for;

    IF ret IS NULL THEN
        ret := fib_cached(fib_for - 2) + fib_cached(fib_for - 1);
        INSERT INTO fib_cache (num, fib)
        VALUES (fib_for, ret);
    END IF;
    RETURN ret;

END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


This gets me a big performance boost:


try=% explain analyze select fib_cached(26);
--------------------------
 Total runtime: 50.889 ms

try=% explain analyze select fib_cached(26);
--------------------------
 Total runtime: 2.249 ms


So even before any sequence numbers have been calculated it's a big win,
and after they've been calculated, it is of course even better.

So then, following Dominus's lead, I set about refactoring the original,
recursive version with tail call elimination. Here's what I came up with:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib_stacked(
    n integer
) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    fib_for integer := n;
    branch  integer := 0;
    ret     integer := 0;
    s1      integer := 0;
    stack   integer[][] := ARRAY[ARRAY[0, 0, 0]];
    bound   integer := 1;
BEGIN
    LOOP
        IF fib_for < 2 THEN
            ret := fib_for;
        ELSE
            IF branch = 0 THEN
                WHILE fib_for >= 2 LOOP
                    stack = array_cat(stack, ARRAY[1, 0, fib_for]);
                    fib_for := fib_for - 1;
                END LOOP;
                ret := fib_for;
            ELSIF branch = 1 THEN
                stack = array_cat(stack, ARRAY[2, ret, fib_for]);
                fib_for := fib_for - 2;
                branch  := 0;
                CONTINUE;
            ELSIF branch = 2 THEN
                ret := ret + s1;
            END IF;
        END IF;

        bound := array_upper(stack, 1);
        IF bound <= 1 THEN
            RETURN ret;
        END IF;

        SELECT INTO branch,          s1,              fib_for
                    stack[bound][1], stack[bound][2], stack[bound][3];
        SELECT INTO stack stack[1:bound-1][1:3];
    END LOOP;
    RETURN ret;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


 It took me forever to figure out how to do it, primarily because
arrays in PostgreSQL are quite limited, in the sense that, while can add to
them, you cannot remove from them! Hence the SELECT INTO to
reassign to stack at the end of the loop. That syntax constructs a
completely new, smaller array and assigns it to stack. Ick. Another
problem is that PL/pgSQL does not like an empty multidimensional array; hence
the initial assignment to stack in the DECLARE block.
I then have to remember that the array always has at least one item in it, and
respond accordingly. It didn't much help that SQL arrays start at 1 rather
than 0.

But the big surprise to me was just how badly this function performed:


try=% explain analyze select fib_stacked(26);
-----------------------------
 Total runtime: 30852.697 ms


Yow! So I don't think that's the best approach. But I did figure out
another approach, based on an example I saw in Agile Web Development
with Rails. It's a very simple loop-based approach:


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fib_fast(
    fib_for int
) RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    ret integer := 0;
    nxt integer := 1;
    tmp integer;
BEGIN
    FOR num IN 1..fib_for LOOP
        tmp := ret;
        ret := nxt;
        nxt := tmp + nxt;
    END LOOP;

    RETURN ret;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


This one works the best of all:


try=# explain analyze select fib_fast(26);
-------------------------
 Total runtime: 0.326 ms


Sweet! I was left wondering why this algorithm wasn't used in
HOP, but then realized that it probably didn't fit in with
Dominus's pedagogical goals. But it was an interesting learning experience for
me all the same.

titlepgTAP 0.21 Drops
bodyìG

I just dropped a new version of pgTAP, following a few marathon hack sessions since my talk at PGCon (movie here, BTW). Actually, the new performs_ok() function came about as I wrote the presentation, but all the rest came on the flight home and in the few days since. Not sure when I'll hack on it this much again (it's getting a bit big at 5,758 lines of PL/pgSQL and SQL).

Overall I'm very happy with this release, as it adds a lot of new assertion functions. In particular, I added a slew of functions that test that the objects in a given schema (or visible in the search path, if you prefer) are exactly the objects that should be there. This is useful for a couple of things. For one, Norman Yamada, in his PGCon talk, mentioned that his team was using pgTAP to compare database objects between replicated databases. I like this because it's a great example of using pgTAP for system testing, rather than just unit testing as I've been advocating. See, pgTAP can be used for any kind of testing!

Another use for these functions is in a large organization where many different people might be making changes to a schema. In this scenario, you might have application developers adding new objects to the database (or dropping objects) without necessarily informing the DBAs. Using, for example, tables_are() and functions_are() and continuous testing, the DBAs can see when objects have been modified by the developers. Even better, if the developers are running the pgTAP tests themselves (as they should be!), they will be reminded to add new tests for their changes when the existing tests notice that things have been added or dropped and thus fail.

Beyond that, I added a bunch of new functions for testing functions and a number of other goodies. Check out the release notes for all the details.

With these changes, I've finished nearly everything I've thought of for pgTAP. There are only a few sequence-testing functions left on the To Do list, as well as a call to add a throws_like() function, which I'll throw in soon if no one else steps up. Beyond these changes, I have a few ideas of where to take it next, but so far I'm kind of stumped. Mainly what I think should be done is to add an interface that makes it easier to compare relations (or result sets, if you prefer). Epic does this by allowing query strings to be passed to a function, but I'd really like to keep queries in SQL rather than in SQL strings. I'll be giving it some more thought and will post about it soon.

To get all of the permutations of recurring events, we simply select from a
view rather than from the events table that contains the actual
event data. The view joins events
to recurrence_dates table like so:


CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW recurring_events AS
SELECT id, name, user_id, duration,
       (rd.next_date || ' ' ||
       (starts_at::timestamptz at time zone start_tz)::time)::timestamp
       at time zone start_tz AS starts_at,
       start_tz
  FROM events LEFT JOIN recurrence_dates rd
    ON (events.starts_at::timestamptz at time zone events.start_tz)::date = rd.date
   AND events.recurrence = rd.recurrence;


Then, to get all of the recurrences of events for a user within a week, we
do something like this in the client code:


SELECT *
  FROM recurring_events
 WHERE user_id = 2
   AND starts_at BETWEEN '2007-11-04 07:00:00' AND '2007-11-10 07:59:59';


This works perfectly, as all of our dates and times are stored in UTC
in timestamp columns. We pass UTC times for the appropriate
offset to the query (Pacific Time in this example) and, because the view does
the right thing in mapping the starts_at time for each event to
its proper time zone, we get all of the events within the date range, even if
they are recurrences of an earlier event, and with their times properly
set.

The trouble we're having, however, is all of those conversions. Until last
week, the view just kept everything in UTC and left it to the client to
convert to the proper zone in the start_tz column. But that
didn't work so well when an event's starts_at was during daylight
savings time and recurrences were in standard time: the standard time
recurrences were all an hour off! So I added the repeated instances
of events.starts_at::timestamptz at time zone events.start_tz.
But now the view is really slow.

Since the only thing that has changed is the addition of the time zone
conversions, I believe that the performance penalty is because of them. The
calculation executes multiple times per row: once for the join and once again
for the starts_at column. We can have an awful lot of events for
a given user, and an awful lot of recurrences of a given event. If, for
example, an event recurs daily for 2 years, there will be around 730 rows for
that one event. And the calculation has to be executed for every one of them
before the WHERE clause can be properly evaluated. Ouch! Worse
still, we actually have three columns that do this in our
application, not just one as in the example here.

So what I need is a way to execute that calculation just once for each
row in the events table, rather than once for each row in the
recurring_events view. I figure 1 calculation will be a heck of a
lot faster than 730! So the question is, how do I do this? How do I get the
view to execute the conversion of the starts_at to
the start_tz time zone only once for each row
in events, regardless of how many rows it ends up generating in
the recurring_events view?

Suggestions warmly welcomed. This is a bit of a tickler for me, and
since the query performance on these views is killing us, I need to get
this adjusted post haste!

Meanwhile, tomorrow I'll post a cool hack I came up with for validating
time zones in the database. Something to look forward to as you ponder my
little puzzle, eh?

Update 2008-01-30: Thanks to help from depesz, I came
figured out what the underling problem was and solved it much more elegantly
using PL/pgSQL. I've now written up the basic recipe.

titleNo more USE_PGXS=1?
bodyë]I've become very tired of having to set USE_PGXS=1 every time I build pgTAP outside the contrib directory of a PostgreSQL distribution:

make USE_PGXS=1
make USE_PGXS=1 install
make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck


I am forever forgetting to set it, and it‚Äôs just not how one normally expects
a build incantation to work. It was required because that‚Äôs how the core
contrib extensions work: They all have
this code in their Makefiles, which those of us who develop third-party
modules have borrowed:

ifdef USE_PGXS
PG_CONFIG = pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
else
subdir = contrib/citext
top_builddir = ../..
include $(top_builddir)/src/Makefile.global
include $(top_srcdir)/contrib/contrib-global.mk
endif


They generally expect ../../src/Makefile.global to exist, and if it doesn‚Äôt,
you have to tell it so. I find this annoying, because third-party extensions
are almost never built from the contrib directory, so one must always remember to specify USE_PGXS=1.

I'd like to propose, instead, that those of us who maintain third-party extensions like pgTAP, PL/Parrot, and Temporal PostgreSQL not force our users to have to remember this special variable by instead checking to see if it‚Äôs needed ourselves. As such, I've just added this code to pgTAP‚Äôs Makefile:

ifdef USE_PGXS
PG_CONFIG = pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
else
ifeq (exists, $(shell [ -e ../../src/bin/pg_config/pg_config ] && echo exists) ) 
top_builddir = ../..
PG_CONFIG := $(top_builddir)/src/bin/pg_config/pg_config
else
PG_CONFIG = pg_config
PGXS := $(shell $(PG_CONFIG) --pgxs)
endif
endif


So it still respects USE_PGXS=1, but if it‚Äôs not set, it looks to see if it
can find pg_config where it would expect it to be if built from the
contrib directory. If it‚Äôs not there, it simply uses pg_config as if
USE_PGXS=1 was set. This makes building from the contrib directory or from
anywhere else the same process:

make
make install
make installcheck


Much better, much easier to remember.

Is there any reason why third-party PostgreSQL extensions should not adopt this pattern? I don‚Äôt think it makes sense for contrib extensions in core to do it, but for those that will never be in core, I think it makes a lot of sense.

title*PostgreSQL Development: Lessons for Perl?
bodyÅïPondering Conservatism

I've been following chromatic's
new blog since it launched, and have read with particular interest
his posts on the Perl 5 development and release process. The very long time
between releases of stable versions of Perl has concerned me for a while,
though I hadn't paid much attention until recently. There has been a fair
amount of discussion about what it means for a release to be ‚Äústable,‚Äù from,
among others, now-resigned Perl Pumpking
Rafael
Garcia-Suarez and Perl 5 contributor
chromatic.
Reading this commentary, I started to ponder what other major open-source
projects might consider ‚Äústable,‚Äù and how they manage stability in their
development and release processes. And it occurred to me that the Perl 5
code base is simultaneously treated too conservatively and -- more importantly
-- not conservatively enough. What open-source projects treat their
code highly conservatively?

If you think about most software needs, you will seldom find more
conservatism than in the use of relational databases. It's not just that the
code needs to continue to work version after version, but that the
data needs to remain intact. If your application doesn't work quite
right on a new version of Perl, you might lose some time reverting to an older
version of Perl. Hell, for a massive deployment, you might lose a lot of time.
But if something happens to the data in your RDBMS, you could lose your
whole business! So database developers need to be extremely careful
about their releases -- even more careful than Perl developers -- so as not to
kill off entire businesses with regressions.

The PostgreSQL RDBMS is especially
noted for its stability over time. So I thought it might be worthwhile to look
at how
the PostgreSQL project works.

PostgreSQL Development Organization

First, there is no one person in charge of PostgreSQL development. There is
no benevolent dictator,
no Pumpking, just a
7-member core team that
collectively makes decisions about release schedules, security issues, and,
whatnot. Several members of the team are of course core hackers, but some
handle PR or release management and are less familiar with internals. The core
team has a moderated mail list on which they can discuss issues amongst
themselves, such as when to put out new releases. But most development and
contribution issues are discussed on
the pgsql-hackers mail list, which corresponds
to the perl5-porters list. The vast majority of
the decisions about what does and does not get into the core takes place on
this list, leaving the core team to take on only those issues which are
irresolvable by the community at large.

After each major release of PostgreSQL (most recently,
8.4 two weeks
ago), the pgsql-hackers list
discusses and
agrees
to a commit fest and release schedule for the next major version of
PostgreSQL. The schedule is typically for about a year, and despite the

occasional worry about the increasing time between major releases (up to
16 months between 8.3 and 8.4), there is in fact a major new release of
PostgreSQL -- with significant new features -- every 9-18
months. That's an incredibly aggressive release cycle; I'd love to
see Perl 5.10 followed by 5.12 just a year later.

This is the liberal part of the PostgreSQL development process: freely accepting
patches and working them in to the core via commit fests over the course of 6-8
months and relying on the
build farm to quickly address
regressions. The commit fests were introduced for the 8.4 schedule to make it
easier for the core hackers to track, review, and commit contributed patches.
They last for a month and take place every other month, and while there were
some hiccups with them the first time around, they were enough of a success
that a
dedicated Webapp has been built to manage
them for 8.5 and beyond. Community members are
encouraged to independently
test patches, just to confirm that things work as expected before one of
the committers dedicates the time. This allows new development to progress
quickly over the course of 6-8 months before a feature freeze is declared and
the project enters a beta- and release-candidate release cycle. Once a release
candidate goes for two weeks or so without a major regression, it's declared
done, the x.x.0 release drops, and CVS HEAD is
opened for
development of the next major version.

PostgreSQL's Code Conservatism

With all the activity around adding new features and the occasional
backward incompatibility to PostgreSQL, you might wonder wherein lies the
conservatism I mentioned. Well, it's this: every time a major new version of
PostgreSQL ships, a maintenance branch is forked for it; and thereafter only
bug fixes and security issues are committed to it. Nothing
else. PostgreSQL's maintenance branches are treated very
conservatively; even documentation patches are accepted only for CVS HEAD.

How do things get applied to maintenance branches? When a committer applies
a patch to CVS HEAD, he or she also evaluates whether the patch is relevant to
actively maintained earlier versions of PostgreSQL, and applies the patch
(with appropriate modifications) to those versions. All such changes are
committed all at once, or in a series of commits with exactly the same commit
message. For example, here's
a commit
by Tom Lane fixing a bug in PL/pgSQL last October and back-patching it
through all supported versions except 7.4, which did not have the problem. As
you can see, there is no cherry-picking of commits from HEAD here. It is the
responsibility of the committer to ensure that bug fixes are applied to all
supported branches of PostgreSQL -- at the same time.

The upshot of this approach is that the PostgreSQL project can be explicit
about what versions of PostgreSQL it maintains (in terms of regular releases
with bug fixes and security patches) and can quickly deliver new releases of
those versions. Because so little changes in maintenance branches other than
demonstrable bug fixes, there is little concern over breaking people's
installations. For example, on March 2 of this year, Tom
Lane fixed
a bug in all supported versions of PostgreSQL that addressed
a security vulnerability. The core hackers decided
that this issue was important enough that
they delivered new releases of all of those
versions of PostgreSQL (8.3.7, 8.2.13, 8.1.17, 8.0.21 and 7.4.25 -- yes, there
have been 26 releases of 7.4!) on March 17, just two weeks later. More serious
security issues have been addressed by new releases within a day or two of
being fixed.

In short, thanks to its formal support policy and its insistence on
applying only bug fixes to supported versions and applying them to all
maintenance branches at once, the PostgreSQL project can regularly and
quickly deliver stable new releases of PostgreSQL.

An Insight

Now let's contrast PostgreSQL development practice with the Perl approach. I
had assumed that major versions of Perl (5.8.x, 5.10.x) were maintained as
stable releases, with just bug fixes going into releases after the .0
versions. After all, the PostgreSQL practice isn't so uncommon;
we do much the same thing for Bricolage. So I
was stunned last weekend to see
this post, by Perl 5.10 Pumpking Dave Mitchell,
suggesting that inclusion of autodie in the core be pushed back from 5.10.1 to
5.10.2. The fact that a major new module/pragma is being added to a minor
release (and it looks like things were worked out so that autodie can stay in
5.10.1) highlights the fact that minor releases of Perl are not, in
fact, maintenance releases. They are, rather, major new
versions of Perl.

This probably should have been obvious to me already because,
notwithstanding Nicholas Clark's heroic delivery of new versions of Perl 5.8
every three months for close to two years, minor releases of Perl tend to come
out infrequently. Perl 5.10.0 was released over a year and a half ago, and it
looks like 5.10.1 will be out in August. That's a standard timeline for
major releases. No wonder it's so bloody much work to put together a
new release of Perl! This insight also helps to explain David Golden's suggestion to change
Perl version number scheme to support, for example, 5.10.0.1. I couldn't see
the point at first, but now I understand the motivation. I'm not sure it's the
best idea, but the ability to have proper bug-fix-only maintenance releases of
officially supported versions of Perl would be a definite benefit.

Last week came a new surprise: Rafael Garcia-Suarez has
resigned as Perl 5.12 Pumpking. This is a
sad event for Perl 5, as Rafael has done a ton of great work over the last five
years -- most recently with the
smart-match operator borrowed from
Perl 6. But I think that it's also an opportunity, a time to re-evaluate how
Perl 5 development operates, and to consider organizational and structural
changes to development and release management. (And, yes, I also want to see
5.10.1 out the door before just about anything else.)

Modest Proposals

I'm a newcomer to the Perl 5 Porters list, but not to Perl (I started
hacking Perl in 1995, my first programming language). So I hope that it's not
too impertinent of me to draw on the example of PostgreSQL to make some
suggestions as to how things might be reorganized to the benefit of the
project and the community.


  Create a cabal.
  
    It seems to me that the pressure of managing the direction of Perl
      development is too great for one person. The history of Perl is littered
      with the remains of Perl Pumpkings. I can think of only two former
      Pumpkings who are still actively involved in the
      project: Nicholas Clark and
      Chip Salzenberg. Most (all?) of
      the others are gone, and even Chip
      took a break for a few years. Tim Bunce is
      still active in the project, but not in core development. I'm loathe to
      recommend design-by-committee, but the nature of the perl5-porters list
      reveals that such is already the case, and the committee is too
      big. Why should one person alone take on the stress of dealing with it
      all, of defending executive decisions?
    I think that PostgreSQL gets this one right (or at least more right)
      with its core team. It's intentionally limited to a very small group,
      and each of the members has equal say. The group sets parameters for
      things like release scheduling and makes decisions that the community at
      large can't agree to, but otherwise is fairly hands-off. Responsibility
      is shared by all members, and they help each other or refer to decisions
      made between them in the context of heated discussions on the
      pgsql-hackers list. It's more of a guiding structure than a leadership
      role, and it works well for an unstructured project like open-source
      development.
    Rather than make just one person responsible for each major version of
      Perl, handling all executive decisions, managing commits and
      back-patches and defending decisions, wouldn't it work better to have a
      small group of people doing it? Couldn't you see RGS, Dave Mitchell
      (who, it seems, has also
      suggested breaking
      up the Pumpking role), Chip, Nicholas, and a few other parties with
      a significant investment in the development and maintenance of the Perl
      core (mst? Jesse Vincent? Larry???) gently guiding development and
      community participation, not to mention maintenance and release
      management? Perl is a big project: the huge responsibility for
      maintaining it should be distributed among a number of people, rather
      than be a heavy burden for one person who then burns out.
  
  Establish a policy for supported versions.
  
    What is the oldest major version of Perl that's officially supported by
      the project? I don't know, either. I guess it's 5.8, but only because
      Nicholas picked up the gauntlet and got 5.8.9 out last year. 5.6? Not so
      much (we got 5.6.2 a couple years back, but will there be a 5.6.3?).
      5.4? Forget about it. I can guess what's supported because of my
      familiarity with the project, but who knows for sure? What does the
      community (read: perl5-porters) commit to continuing to fix and release?
      There is no official statement.
    It would be really beneficial to know -- that is, for an explicit
      maintenance policy to be articulated and maintained. Such a policy would
      allow third parties to know exactly what versions of Perl will continue
      to work and what versions will be deprecated and dropped. Of course, to
      do this realistically, it will have to get easier to deliver maintenance
      releases, and that means the project will have to‚Ä¶
  
  Use minor versions for bug fixes only.
  
    The fact that there are effectively no bug-fix-only releases of Perl
      is, in my opinion, a huge problem. Regressions can sit for months or
      even years with fixes without seeing a release. You can't just tell
      people to apply a patch or rely on distribution packagers to fix up the
      patches (hell, certain packagers tend to break Perl by leaving such
      patches in place for years!).
    So the Perl project needs maintenance branches that are actively
      maintained by back-patching all bug fixes as appropriate as they are
      committed to blead. The maintenance branches always ought to be in
      a state such that they're identical to their initial releases plus bug
      fixes. This also goes for any dual-life modules: no new features, just
      bug fixes. By adhering to a strict regimen for maintaining such
      branches, the core team can tag a release at any time with just a few
      steps. Such will be important to fix serious security issues, bugs, or
      performance regressions in a timely manner, and will likely help prevent
      package maintainers from wandering too far from core releases.
    Ideally, such branches would be for a major version number. For
      example, there would be a branch for 5.10 and one for 5.8. For the 5.10
      branch, maintenance releases would be 5.10.2, 5.10.3, etc. If that's not
      do-able because of the current practice of the minor release numbers
      actually being major releases, perhaps the branch would be 5.10.1 and
      maintenance releases would be 5.10.1.1, 5.10.1.2, etc. Such is the path
      the Git project follows, for example. Or perhaps we could change the
      numbers altogether: make the next major release ‚ÄúPerl 5 v10.1.0,‚Äù the
      maintenance branch v10.1, and the next maintenance release 10.1.2. The
      next major release would be 10.2.0 or, eventually, 12.0.0.
    That last suggestion probably won't fly, and the first option would,
      frankly, be more to my liking, but the point is to have some
      logical versioning system to make it easy to identify major releases and
      maintenance releases. Ultimately it doesn't really matter what version
      numbers are used, as long as their use is consistent.
  
  Update smoke testers to simplify regression tracking.
  
    Like the
      PostgreSQL build farm, we need a way to
      quickly see what works and what doesn't for all maintained versions of
      Perl. I'm not familiar with the smoke testing configuration, so maybe it
      does this already. But ideally, the system would be easy to set up,
      would check out and build every officially supported version of Perl,
      run the test suite, and send the results back to a central database. Via
      the interface for that database, you could see what versions and revisions
      of Perl are passing or failing tests on every reporting platform at any
      moment in time. And finally, you'd be able to see the full TAP output of
      all tests (or maybe just particular test scripts?) so that it's easy to
      jump down into the test results and see failure diagnostics, to allow a
      developer go get an early start on fixing failures without having to ask
      the server owner to run the tests again.
    Bonus points for plugging in results from cpan-testers for each
      version, too.
  
  Fix and record as you go.
  
    I alluded to this already, but it deserves its own section: Back-patch
      bug fixes to all appropriate maintenance branches as you go. And as you
      make those fixes, record them in a changes file, so that the release
      manager doesn't have to dig through the commit logs to figure out what's
      changed from version to version. The existing practice -- where the
      Pumpking decides it's time for a release and spends weeks or months
      cherry-picking fixes from blead and trolling through the logs for
      changes -- just doesn't scale: it puts all the work onto one person,
      leading directly to the very real possibility for burnout. Getting a
      release ready is hard enough without all the extra busy work. The only
      effective way to keep things up-to-date and well recorded at all times
      is to, well, keep things up-to-date and well recorded at all
      times.
    If the project committers adhere to this practice, it will always be
      easy to get a maintenance release out with just a day's worth of work --
      and perhaps less. If the code is always ready for release, it can always
      be released. Perhaps the smoke farm is given a day or two to show that
      there are no regressions, but otherwise, release early, release
      often.
  


The Goal

These are some of the lessons I take away from observing the differences
between PostgreSQL development and Perl development. There are other changes
that might be worthwhile, such as eliminating the overhead created by
dual-life modules and articulating an explicit deprecation policy. Such issues
have been covered elsewhere, however, and not practiced by or relevant to the
PostgreSQL example.

As for the comparison, I recognize that there are no exact parallels (one
hacker I know who has worked on both projects says that the PostgreSQL source code is
a lot cleaner and easier to work with than the Perl soure, and
therefore it's easier to maintain and prep for release), but surely ideas can
be borrowed and put to good use. Ultimately, I'd really like to see changes to
the Perl development and release process to enable:


  More frequent stable releases of Perl
  More rapid development and delivery of major releases of Perl
  Less work and stress for core maintainers
  Greater predictability and accessibility for users


There's a lot here, but if you take only two things away from this essay,
let them be these suggestions:


  establish a cabal to spread the burden of responsibility and decision
    making, and
  maint should be much more conservative about changes


Both are very simple and very effective. What do you think?

My thanks to Bruce Momjian, Tim Bunce, chromatic, and Nicholas
Clark for reviewing earlier drafts of this essay and providing invaluable
feedback and suggestions -- many of which I accepted. Any errors of course
remain completely my own.

title6Enforce Foreign Key Integrity in SQLite with Triggers
bodyüjAfter some some Googling and experimentation, I've figured out how to
enforce foreign key constraints in SQLite. I got most of the code from Cody
Pisto's sqlite_fk utility. I couldn't get it to work, but the essential
code for the triggers was in its fk.c file, so I just borrowed from
that (public domain) code to figure it out.

Since I couldn't find documentation for this elsewhere on the Net (though
I'm sure it exists somewhere), I decided to just put an example here.
Interested? Read on!

Say you have these two table declarations:


create table foo (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE bar (
  id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  foo_id INTEGER NOT NULL
         CONSTRAINT fk_foo_id REFERENCES a(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);


Table bar has a foreign key reference to the primary key
column in the foo table. Although SQLite supports this syntax (as
well as named foreign key constraints), it ignores them. So if you want the
references enforced, you need to create triggers to do the job. Triggers were
added to SQLite version 2.5, so most users can take advantage of this
feature. Each constraint must have three triggers: one for INSERTs,
one for UPDATESs, and one for DELETESs. The
INSERT trigger looks like this:


CREATE TRIGGER fki_bar_foo_id
BEFORE INSERT ON bar
FOR EACH ROW BEGIN 
  SELECT CASE
     WHEN ((SELECT id FROM foo WHERE id = NEW.foo_id) IS NULL)
     THEN RAISE(ABORT, 'insert on table "bar" violates foreign key '
                || 'constraint "fk_foo_id"')
  END;
END;


(You can put the RAISE error string all on one line; I've
concatenated two lines to keep line lengths reasonable here.) If your foreign
key column is not NOT NULL, the trigger's SELECT
CASE clause needs to an extra case:


CREATE TRIGGER fki_bar_foo_id
BEFORE INSERT ON bar
FOR EACH ROW BEGIN 
   SELECT CASE
     WHEN ((new.foo_id IS NOT NULL)
           AND ((SELECT id FROM foo WHERE id = new.foo_id) IS NULL))
     THEN RAISE(ABORT, 'insert on table "bar" violates foreign key '
                || 'constraint "fk_foo_id"')
  END;
END;


The UPDATE statements are almost identical; if your foreign
key column is NOT NULL, then do this:


CREATE TRIGGER fku_bar_foo_id
BEFORE UPDATE ON bar
FOR EACH ROW BEGIN 
   SELECT CASE
     WHEN ((SELECT id FROM foo WHERE id = new.foo_id) IS NULL))
     THEN RAISE(ABORT, 'update on table "bar" violates foreign key '
                || 'constraint "fk_foo_id"')
  END;
END;


And if NULLs are allowed, do this:


CREATE TRIGGER fku_bar_foo_id
BEFORE UPDATE ON bar
FOR EACH ROW BEGIN 
   SELECT CASE
     WHEN ((new.foo_id IS NOT NULL)
           AND ((SELECT id FROM foo WHERE id = new.foo_id) IS NULL))
     THEN RAISE(ABORT, 'update on table "bar" violates foreign key '
                || 'constraint "fk_foo_id"')
  END;
END;


The DELETE trigger is, of course, the reverse of
the INSERT and UPDATE triggers, in that it
applies to the primary key table, rather than the foreign key table.
To whit, in our example, it watches for DELETEs on the
foo table:


CREATE TRIGGER fkd_bar_foo_id
BEFORE DELETE ON foo
FOR EACH ROW BEGIN 
  SELECT CASE
    WHEN ((SELECT foo_id FROM bar WHERE foo_id = OLD.id) IS NOT NULL)
    THEN RAISE(ABORT, 'delete on table "foo" violates foreign key '
               || ' constraint "fk_foo_id"')
  END;
END;


This trigger will prevent DELETEs on the foo
table when there are existing foreign key references in the bar
table. This is generally the default behavior in databases with referential
integrity enforcement, sometimes specified explicitly as ON DELETE
RESTRICT. But sometimes you want the deletes in the primary key table
to cascade to the foreign key tables. Such is what our example
declaration above specifies, and this is the trigger to to the job:


CREATE TRIGGER fkd_bar_foo_id
BEFORE DELETE ON foo
FOR EACH ROW BEGIN 
    DELETE from bar WHERE foo_id = OLD.id;
END;


Pretty simple, eh? The trigger support in SQLite is great for building your
own referential integrity checks. Hopefully, these examples will get you
started down the path of creating your own.

title*Add Regular Expression Operator to SQLite
bodyô.As I discussed a couple of months ago, DBD::SQLite exposes the SQLite qlite3_create_function() API for adding Pure-Perl functions and aggregates to SQLite on a per-connection basis.  This is cool, but in perusing the SQLite expression documentation, I came across this gem:

The REGEXP operator is a special syntax for the regexp() user function. No regexp() user function is defined by default and so use of the REGEXP operator will normally result in an error message. If a user-defined function named regexp is defined at run-time, that function will be called in order to implement the REGEXP operator.

Well hell! I thought. I can do that!

In a brief search, I could find no further documentation of this feature, but all it took was a little experimentation to figure it out. The regexp() function should expect two arguments. The first is the regular expression, and the second is the value to match. So it can be added to DBD::SQLite like this:


$dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:SQLite:dbfile=test.db');
$dbh->func('regexp', 2, sub {
    my ($regex, $string) = @_;
    return $string =~ /$regex/;
}, 'create_function');


Yep, that's it! Now, I have my own module for handling database connections, and I wanted to make sure that all of my custom functions are always present, every time I connect to the database. In a mod_perl environment, you can end up with a lot of connections, and a single process has the potential disconnect and reconnect more than once (due to exceptions thrown by the database and whatnot). The easiest way to ensure that the functions are always there as soon as you connect and every time you connect, I learned thanks to a tip from Tim Bunce, is to subclass the DBI and implement a connected() method. Here's what it looks like:


package MyApp::SQLite;
use base 'DBI';

package MyApp::SQLite::st;
use base 'DBI::st';

package MyApp::SQLite::db;
use base 'DBI::db';

sub connected {
    my $dbh = shift;
    # Add regexp function.
    $dbh->func('regexp', 2, sub {
        my ($regex, $string) = @_;
        return $string =~ /$regex/;
    }, 'create_function');
}


So how does this work? Here's a quick app I wrote to demonstrate the use of the REGEXP expression in SQLite using Perl regular expressions:


#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

my $dbfile = shift || die "Usage: $0 db_file\n";
my $dbh = MyApp::SQLite->connect(
    "dbi:SQLite:dbname=$dbfile", '', '',
    {
        RaiseError  => 1,
        PrintError  => 0,
    }
);

END {
    $dbh->do('DROP TABLE try');
    $dbh->disconnect;
}

$dbh->do('CREATE TABLE try (a TEXT)');

my $ins = $dbh->prepare('INSERT INTO try (a) VALUES (?)');
for my $val (qw(foo bar bat woo oop craw)) {
    $ins->execute($val);
}

my $sel = $dbh->prepare('SELECT a FROM try WHERE a REGEXP ?');

for my $regex (qw( ^b a w?oop?)) {
    print "'$regex' matches:\n  ";
    print join "\n  " =>
        @{ $dbh->selectcol_arrayref($sel, undef, $regex) };
    print "\n\n";
}


This script outputs:


'^b' matches:
  bar
  bat

'a' matches:
  bar
  bat
  craw

'w?oop?' matches:
  foo
  woo
  oop



Pretty slick, no? I wonder if it'd make sense for DBD::SQLite to add the regexp() function itself, in C, using the Perl API, so that it's just always available to DBD::SQLite apps?

titleCustom Aggregates in Perl
body¢wAbout a year ago, Josh Berkus was reviewing some Bricolage SQL code, looking to optimize it for PostgreSQL. One of the things he noticed was that we were fetching a lot more rows for an object than we needed to. The reason for this is that an object might be associated with one or more groups, and to get back a list of all of the group IDs, we were getting multiple rows. For example, if I wanted to fetch a single story with the ID 10, I might get back rows like this:


SELECT s.id, s.title, grp.id
FROM   story s, member m, grp g
WHERE  s.id = m.story_id
       AND m.grp_id = g.id
       AND s.id = 10;
s.id |        s.title      | grp.id
-----+---------------------+--------
  10 | The Princess Bride  | 23
  10 | The Princess Bride  | 24
  10 | The Princess Bride  | 25
  10 | The Princess Bride  | 26
  10 | The Princess Bride  | 27


Now, that's a lot of extra data to have to fetch for just a single row to be different; it's very wasteful, really. So Josh said, Why don't you use a custom aggregate for that? I knew nothing about aggregates, but I did some research, and figured out how to write PostgreSQL custom aggregates in SQL. I wrote a very simple one, called id_list(), that joins up all of the values in a column with an empty space. The aggregate code looks like this:


CREATE   FUNCTION append_id(TEXT, INTEGER)
RETURNS  TEXT AS '
    SELECT CASE WHEN $2 = 0 THEN
                $1
           ELSE
                $1 || '' '' || CAST($2 AS TEXT)
           END;'
LANGUAGE 'sql'
WITH     (ISCACHABLE, ISSTRICT);

CREATE AGGREGATE id_list (
    SFUNC    = append_id,
    BASETYPE = INTEGER,
    STYPE    = TEXT,
    INITCOND = ''
);


Now I was able to vastly simplify the results returned by the query:


SELECT s.id, s.title, id_list(grp.id)
FROM   story s, member m, grp g
WHERE  s.id = m.story_id
       AND m.grp_id = g.id
       AND s.id = 10;
GROUP BY s.id, s.title
s.id |        s.title      | id_list
-----+---------------------+---------------
  10 | The Princess Bride  | 23 24 25 26 27


So then I just had to split the id_list column on the white space and I was ready to go. Cool!

So recently, was thinking about how I might do something similar in SQLite. It turns out that SQLite has a way to add custom aggregates, too, via its sqlite_add_function function. But I don't know C, and had been wondering for a while how, even if I figured out how to write an aggregate function in C, whether I would have to require users to compile SQLite with my C aggregate in order to get it to work.

However, as a Perl developer, I thought it might be worthwhile to just quickly check the DBD::SQLite docs might have to say on the matter. And it turns out that the ability to add aggregates to SQLite is supported in DBD::SQLite via the create_aggregate custom function. And what's more, the aggregate can be written in Perl! Whoa! I couldn't believe that it could be that easy, but a quick test script demonstrated that it is:


#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

use DBI;

my $dbfile = shift;
my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLite:dbname=$dbfile", '', '');

END {
    $dbh->disconnect;
    unlink $dbfile;
};

$dbh->do('CREATE TABLE foo (a int)');
$dbh->do('BEGIN');
$dbh->do('INSERT INTO foo (a) VALUES (?)', undef, $_) for 1..10;
$dbh->do('COMMIT');

# Create a new aggregate.
$dbh->func('joiner', 1, 'My::Join', 'create_aggregate');

my $sel = $dbh->prepare(q{SELECT joiner(a) FROM foo});
$sel->execute;
$sel->bind_columns(\my $val);
print "$val\n" while $sel->fetch;


The first argument to create_aggregate() (itself invoked via the DBI func() method) the name of the aggregate, the second is the number of arguments to the aggregate (use -1 for an unlimited number), and the third is the name of a Perl class that implements the aggregate. That class needs just three methods: new(), an object constructor; step(), called for each aggregate row, and finalize, which must return the value calculated by the aggregate. My simple implementation looks like this:


package My::Join;

sub new { bless [] }
sub step {
    my $self = shift;
    push @$self, @_;
}
sub finalize {
    my $self = shift;
    return join q{ }, @$self;
}


Yep, that's really it! When I run the script, the output looks like this:


% try foo
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


Keen! I mean, that is just so slick! And it really demonstrates the power of SQLite as an embeddable database, as well. Thanks Matt, for making the SQLite API available to us mere mortal Perl developers!

title Intelligent MySQL Configuration
bodyùJJames Duncan Davidson's Configuring MySQL on MacOS X post earlier today reminded me that I wanted to blog about the configuration I came up with while installing MySQL 5 on my box. Nothing has irritated me more than when MySQL's syntax has violated the ANSI SQL standards in the most blatant ways, or when transactions have appeared to work, but mysteriously not worked. Yes, I use Duncan's settings to make sure that the MySQL box on my PowerBook only listens on local sockets, but I additionally add this configuration to /etc/my.cnf:


[mysqld]
sql-mode=ansi,strict_trans_tables,no_auto_value_on_zero,no_zero_date,no_zero_in_date,only_full_group_by
character-set-server=utf8
default-storage-engine=InnoDB
default-time-zone=utc


That last configuration can actually only be added after running this command:


/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | \
mysql -u root mysql


But then the upshot is that I have everything configured to be as compliant as possible (although the time zone stuff is just my personal preference):

Now that's the way things should be! Or at least as close as I'm going to get to it in MySQL 5.

Update 2006-11-04: Ask Bj√∏rn Hansen turned me on to the strict_trans_tables mode, which prevents MySQL from trying to guess what you mean when you leave out a value for a required column. So I've now updated my configuration with sql-mode=ansi,strict_trans_tables.

Update 2009-11-05: I found myself configuring MySQL again today, and there were some other settings I found it useful to add:


  no_auto_value_on_zero forces AUTO_INCREMENT columns to increment only when inserting a NULL, rather than when inserting a NULL or a zero(!).
  no_zero_date and no_zero_in_date disallow dates where the the year or month are set to 0.
  only_full_group_by requires that non-aggregated columns in a select list be included in a GROUP BY clause, as is mandated by the SQL standard. This only applies if an aggregate function is used in a query


I've added all of these to the example above.

titleIntroducing MyTAP
body¶I gave my OSCON tutorial (slides) last week. It went okay. I spent way too much time helping to get everyone set up with pgTAP, and then didn't have time to have the attendees do the exercises, and I had to rush through 2.5 hours of material in 1.5 hours. Yikes! At least the video will be better when it's released (more when that happens).

But as often happens, I was asked whether something like pgTAP exists for MySQL. But this time I was asked by MySQL Community Manager Giuseppe Maxia, who also said that he'd tried to create a test framework himself (a fellow Perl hacker!), but that it wasn't as nice as pgTAP. Well, since I was at OSCON and tend to like to hack on side projects while at conferences, and since I hoped that Giuseppe will happily take it over once I've implemented the core, I started hacking on it myself. And today, I'm pleased to announce the release of MyTAP 0.01 (downloads).

Once you've downloaded it, install it against your MySQL server like so:

mysql -u root < mytap.sql

Here's a very simple example script:

-- Start a transaction.
BEGIN;

-- Plan the tests.
SELECT tap.plan(1);

-- Run the tests.
SELECT tap.pass( 'My test passed, w00t!' );

-- Finish the tests and clean up.
CALL tap.finish();
ROLLBACK;


You can run this test from a .sql file using the mysql  client like so:

mysql -u root --disable-pager --batch --raw --skip-column-names --unbuffered --database try --execute 'source test.sql'


But that's a PITA and can only run one test at a time. Instead, put all of your tests into a directory, perhaps named tests, each with the suffix ‚Äú.my‚Äù, and use my_prove (install TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::MyTAP from CPAN to get it) instead:

my_prove -u root --database try tests/

For MyTAP's own tests, the output looks like this:

tests/eq.my ........ ok
tests/hastap.my .... ok
tests/matching.my .. ok
tests/moretap.my ... ok
tests/todotap.my ... ok
tests/utils.my ..... ok
All tests successful.
Files=6, Tests=137,  1 wallclock secs
(0.06 usr  0.03 sys +  0.01 cusr  0.02 csys =  0.12 CPU)
Result: PASS


Nice, eh? Of course there are quite a few more assertion functions. See the complete documentation for details.

Now, I did my best to keep the interface the same as pgTAP, but there are a few differences:


MySQL temporary tables are teh suck, so I had to use permanent tables to track test state. To make this more feasible, MyTAP is always installed in its own database, (named ‚Äútap‚Äù by default), and you must always schema-qualify your use of the MyTAP functions.
Another side-effect of permanent tables is that MyTAP must keep track of test outcomes without colliding with the state from tests running in multiple concurrent connections. So MyTAP uses connection_id() to keep track of state for a single test run. It also deletes the state when tests finish(), but if there's a crash before then, data can be left in those tables. If the connection ID is ever re-used, this can lead to conflicts. This seems mostly avoidable by using InnoDB tables and transactions in the tests.
The word ‚Äúis‚Äù is strictly reserved by MySQL, so the function that corresponds to pgTAP's is()  is eq() in MyTAP. Similarly, isnt() is called not_eq() in MyTAP.
There is no way to throw an exception in MySQL functions an procedures, so the code cheats by instead performing an illegal operation: selecting from a non-existent column, where the name of that column is the error message. Hinky, but should get the point across.


Other than these issues, things went fairly smoothly. I finished up the 0.01 version last night and released it today with most of the core functionality in place. And now I want to find others to take over, as I am not a MySQL hacker myself and thus unlikely ever to use it. If you're interested, my recommendations for things to do next are:


Move has_table() to its own file, named mytap-schema.sql or similar, and start porting the relevant pgTAP table assertion functions, schema assertion functions, have assertion functions, function and procedure assertion functions, and assorted other database object assertion functions.
Consider an approach to porting the pgTAP relation comparison assertion functions, perhaps by requiring that prepared statements be created and their names passed to the functions. The functions can then select from the prepared statements into temporary tables to compare results (as in set_eq() and bag_eq()), or use cursors to iterate over the prepared statements row-by-row (as in results_eq())
Set up a mail list and a permanent home for MyTAP (I've used GitHub pages for the current site, but I don't think it should remain tightly associated with my GitHub identity). I'd like to see some folks from the MySQL community jump on this.


So fork on GitHub or contact me if you'd like to be added as a collaborator (I'm looking at you, Giuseppe!).

Hope you find it useful.

title0MySQL's <code>REPLACE</code> Considered Harmful
bodyñ So we've set up a client with an online poll application using MySQL. Polls
are created in Bricolage, and when they're published, rather than writing data
to files, the template writes data to the MySQL database. PHP code on the
front-end server then uses the database records to manage the polls.

On the recommendation of one of my colleagues, I was using the MySQL REPLACE statement to insert and
update poll answers in the database. At first, this seemed like a cool idea.
All I had to do was create a unique index on the story_id
and ord (for answer order) columns and I was set. Any time
someone reordered the answers or changed their wording in Bricolage,
the REPLACE statement would change the appropriate records and
just do the right thing.

Or so I thought.

Come the day after the launch of the new site, I get a complaint from the
customer that the percentage spread between the answers doesn't add up to
100%. After some investigation, I realized that the poll_results
table is using the ID of each question to identify the votes submitted by
readers. This makes sense, of course, and is excellent relational practice,
but I have overlooked the fact that REPLACE essentially replaces
rows every time it is used. This means that even when a poll answer hasn't
changed, it gets a new ID. Yes, that's right, its primary key value was
changing. Yow!

Now we might have caught this earlier, but the database was developed on
MySQL 3.23.58 and, as is conventional among MySQL developers, there were no
foreign key constraints. So the poll results were still happily pointing to
non-existent records. So a poll might appear to have 800 votes, but the
percentages might be counted for only 50 votes. Hence the problem with the
percentages not adding up to 100% (nowhere near it, in fact).

Fortunately, the production application is on a MySQL 4.1 server, so I
made a number of changes to correct this issue:


  Added foreign key constraints
  Exploited a little-known (mis)feature of Bricolage to store primary keys
    for all poll answers (and questions, for that matter)
  Switched from REPLACE to INSERT,
    UPDATE, and DELETE statements using the primary
    keys


I also started using transactions when making all these updates when a poll
is published so that changes are always atomic. Now it works beautifully.

But the lesson learned is that REPLACE is a harmful construct.
Yes, it was my responsibility to recognize that it would create new rows and
therefore new primary keys. But any construct that changes primary keys should
be stricken from any database developer's toolbox. The fact that MySQL
convention omits the use of foreign key constraints makes this a particularly
serious issue that can appear to have mysterious consequences.

So my advice to you, gentle reader, is don't use it.

The post, which was published about a week before Steve Jobs‚Äôs resignation as CEO of Apple, is worth a read. A number of points came up in the Twitter discussion, but 140 characters prevented me, at least, from being as thoughtful as I‚Äôd like. So I‚Äôm trying again here.

Enterprise Business




Take this sentence from the first paragraph of Kate‚Äôs post:

The recent launch of Apple‚Äôs iCloud service has done much to bring mainstream attention and acceptance to the concept of cloud storage and syncing.  But unless [Apple] adapt an open cloud standard they are facing an uphill struggle to attract business users.  Here‚Äôs why.

That‚Äôs the setup, but reflects a complete misunderstanding of Apple‚Äôs business model. The truth is that Apple does not care about the enterprise. Apple is in the consumer electronics business. Not the entrprise computing business. Certainly not the cloud computing business. Apple is in the business of creating hardware products to sell to consumers. Everything else is secondary to that.

In fairness, Kate does write, toward the end of the piece:

Essentially Apple sees iCloud as a consumer rather than a business service ‚Äì and Apple have never really been interested in enterprises or business, despite the work they done to support policies and enterprise standards like Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync on the iPhone.

Of coure, if Apple is not interested in selling to enterprisese or businesses, it stands to reason that thet won‚Äôt have an uphill struggle attacing those users.

The Android Hurdle

I think the real point of the piece is this:

However most businesses are unlikely to use iCloud until Apple adopt an open cloud standard.  The fact that iCloud won‚Äôt deliver on other platforms like Android smartphones and tablets are going to be a major hurdle for Apple to overcome.

Again, Apple is not really entering the cloud business. Rather, they‚Äôre creating a cloud service to bolster their existing business. Another way to say it is that Apple is not selling cloud services. Apple sells devices that use cloud services. And as a consequence of that, they don‚Äôt care about other devices. The point is not the cloud, it‚Äôs the devices.

In that vein, via Twitter Simon said:

@theory : Modern devices are a combo of activities, some innovative, most commodity. Android & its ecosystem is commoditising the space.

Yes, that‚Äôs just it. Google thinks that they can commoditize the smartphone bussiness, and that the truly valuable business is their cloud services. Apple, on the other hand, believes that cloud services will be the commodities, and that the truly valuable business is selling handheld computers.




Time will tell who‚Äôs right. As ‚Äúcloud entrepreneurs,‚Äù Simon and Kate well understand the Google model. Google wants as many devices as possible to be able to access the cloud services they provide. Apple is not interested in that, because they‚Äôre not in the cloud business. (I know this is getting redundant; sorry about that).

And, frankly, Google‚Äôs not in the cloud business, either. They‚Äôre in the advertising business. And how do you show as many ads to as many people as possible? Well, you provide an easy-to-use utility service like search or email and sell ads to appear on those services.

In short, Google is in the business of selling eyeballs to advertisers. Apple is in the business of selling devices to consumers. Both are valid business models, but given existing revenues, I think it‚Äôs difficult to argue which seems to be the more successful model.

Kate added:

@swardley but my point stands; in consumer space too they are losing ground, fast. Shiny toys are easy to duplicate ‚Äì Nokia‚Äôs doom.

I don‚Äôt follow this reasoning at all, frankly. There were lots of mobile phone manufaturerss that were trying to duplicate Nokia‚Äôs devices. They failed. Apple succeedd not through duplication, but by creating a completely new device that simply made all preceeding devices instantly archaic. And now, yes, Android devices are attempting to duplicate the iPhone, but their sales seem to be mainly at the expense of feature phones. Note that Android‚Äôs share of the mobile browser market is about 16%, wheres iOS accounts for 53%, according to an August 2011 MarketShare report. Yes, there are a lot of Android phones, especially in the US, where only one carrier sold iPhones until earlier this year. But it sure seems like most folks use them more like feature phones than handheld computers. In other words, all those users are not being converted into consumers of cloud services.

And other than on phones, Android‚Äôs market penetration is effetively zero. iOS completely dominates the tablet (no, iPad) and music player markets. Android tablets currently pose no hurdle for iOS at all, and there is no sign that they will for some time to come. The only other tablet computer likely to succed is the Kindle. And guess what? It will mainly use Amazon‚Äôs walled garden of cloud-based products and services.

Cloud Commoditization

Which then leads to the issue of cloud commoditization. From Kate‚Äôs post:

From a standing start 5 years ago Amazon Web Services has grown to an eye-watering $1.4bn in revenue. Rackspace, their leading competitor in the cloud space, is thought to have about one tenth that figure in revenue from cloud. So, Rackspace and the other out-paced cloud providers have clubbed together to create an open, interoperable cloud system.

I think this is absolutely right. And OpenStack just might, in fact, commoditize the the cloud provider market. If it‚Äôs successful, each of the cloud utility companies that emerge will end up competing for that $1.4b in revenue (or, since it‚Äôs a growth space, let‚Äôs call it $5b in revenue in two years, just for the hell of it).  With cloud computing standardized, this will trigger a race to the bottom, and may the cheapest cloud provider win. Already Kate says that her new company‚Äôs offering will be ‚Äúthe cheapest on the market.‚Äù

This has nothing to do with Apple, however. Apple has zero interest in being in a commodity market. Why? Because long-term there‚Äôs no money in it. This is why HP is leaving the PC business. There used to be money in it, but for the last ten years, there is little innovation, just a race to the bottom, just razor thin margins and cost-cutting measures. In the PC business, only one company continues to make large profits from its devices: Apple.

Yes, Apple has a cloud offering, but as with iTunes and the App store, it exists to enhance the experience of using Apple‚Äôs devices. The devices don‚Äôt exist to bring customers to iCloud; iCloud exists to bring customers to iOS. And note that in the second quarter of this year, iOS devices accounted for 75% of Apple‚Äôs profits. That‚Äôs $7.34b in profits, not revenue. For a single quarter ending last May. That‚Äôs a far larger, more lucrative business to be in than Amazon‚Äôs $1.4b in revenue over, what? A year? I think Apple will be happy to leave that substantially smaller business to others.

In fact, given the revelation last week that Apple‚Äôs using Azure and AWS as the foundation for iCloud, the commoditization of cloud services will only help Apple‚Äôs bottom line: they can always switch to less-expensive providers (assuming everything else is equal, of course). So yeah, cloud commiditization just might happen. And Apple, not being in the cloud business, won‚Äôt care, except to the extent that it might reduce its expenses and thus contribute to its bottom line.

Innovation

Following up on his tweet about commoditization, Simon wrote:

Combine this with ability of ecosystems to innovate, then Android is likely to be fairly lethal over time.

As to the second point, I don‚Äôt know how lethal Android will be if it a) doesn‚Äôt make much money for anyone; b) isn‚Äôt used as a handheld computer often enough; and c) cannot compete in the iPad market. But the first point I have a hard time following. How does an ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù innovate? It needs agents to do that, no?

Fortunately, a couple days ago Simon published a piece entitled ‚ÄúThe abuse of innovation.‚Äù His overall argument there is that the term ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù has been overused to mean all kinds of things. No question in my mind. But to which part of his taxonomy might he be referring in his tweet? I suspect it‚Äôs this one:

5. Enablement and acceleration of the innovation of higher order systems through commoditisation of lower order subsystems (i.e. creative destruction and componentisation)

So perhaps for the example of cloud computing, ‚Äúecosystem innovation‚Äù is the creation of applications that run on the cloud? That is, a cloud app is a ‚Äúhigher order system‚Äù running on the cloud, and the cloud is the commodized ‚Äúlower order subsystem.‚Äù I think that makes a lot of sense. I expect people will do all kinds of things building on clouds, and the commoditiazation means they can run such systems on any standardized, inexpensive cloud utility. Cool.

But what has this to do with Apple? Well, they‚Äôre one of those innovators building services on cloud infrastructures. Furthermore, Apple has created its own ecosystem, and there is a ton of innovation going on there. (And, yeah, a lot of duplication: but that‚Äôs a sign of the huge success of the ecosystem.) iOS provides a commoditized platform for the development of innovative applications. The fact that iOS 5 is adding a cloud API is just another piece of that ecosystem. It‚Äôs one detail among many, and possibly key to the ongoing success of the platform. But the cloud is not the foundation of the ecosystem.

Landgrab

And that last paragraph of Kate‚Äôs post? Let‚Äôs take it a apart:

I firmly believe that adoption of open cloud standards is one of the keys to unlock the full and global potential of cloud computing and to breaking down the duopoly of Amazon‚Äôs IaaS and Google‚Äôs consumer SaaS.

I think that may well be right, but there‚Äôs unlikely to be much long-term profit in it. Unless you do something like sell ads to display on the apps running on your cloud utility service. If so, Apple won‚Äôt be a customer, ever.

Jobs & co may be making astonishing profits, and will likely continue to do so for some time, but unless they either out-landgrab Android in the smartphone and tablet market or open their doors to cross-platform services their success may be short-lived.

This assumes that Apple wants success in the cloud business. It doesn‚Äôt. It wants success in the sale of devices. Sure, if Apple stopped innovating it might eventually lose sales and have to start depending more on its cloud services like iTunes and the App Store for profits. But if Apple has shown anything in the last 14 years, it‚Äôs that it doesn‚Äôt stand still. Building a business to try to cash in on one or two products for as long a possible is not in its DNA. Apple thinks far further ahead than that. While Android focuses on commoditizing the handheld computer market to the benefit of Google‚Äôs existing services over the next year, rest assured that Apple is already focused on the next great product that five years from now will change the way we look at things. Again.

But maybe that is not a concern. Maybe, with Jobs‚Äô rumoured ill health, he has decided that there are few more golden apples to lay and that he should cash in while the going is good.

Mixed metaphors aside, it should be noted Steve Jobs has never been interested in profit. In 1987 he told Playboy:

You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it‚Äôs humorous, all the attention to it, because it‚Äôs hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that‚Äôs happened to me in the past ten years.

Apple has been modeled on this point of view. It is a product-driven company far more interested in the next great thing than in cashing in.

Upshot

Apple is not in the cloud business. It‚Äôs not in the enterprise computing business. It‚Äôs not interested providing utility services. And it‚Äôs unlikely ever to be.  Apple‚Äôs actual business is far more successful, interesting, and profitable to them. So the question of whether or not iCloud should be ‚Äúopen‚Äù is unlikely to even be on Apple‚Äôs radar. What‚Äôs on their radar is not ‚Äúbeing open,‚Äù but selling great products.

Much to my amusement, Twitter seems to think that I've tweeted over 5,000 times. I don‚Äôt see how this can possibly be, but there are days when I tweet a log I guess. Still, 5,000 in a little under three years seems‚Ä¶excessive. I realize that it counts DMs and retweets in that number (not many retweets yet, of course), but still, I question their algorithm. Since one can‚Äôt access one‚Äôs entire history of tweets (yet?), I can‚Äôt count for myself, either, alas.



In other news, I‚Äôve been slowly making may way through my photos from the family trip to Japan. Yesterday, I posted photos from Kiyomizu-dera, Gion, and Teramachi, taken our first day in Kyoto. What a fabulously beautiful place! We walked around for hours, and it was a photographic feast. It was all I could do to trim things down to just 63 photos. I have many hundreds more to process still, from Kyoto, Nara, and Tokyo. I'll get them up over the next week.

As for my current status? I realize I've been blogging less, but I've been no less busy hacking Perl and PostgreSQL stuff. In addition to ushering out a new version of Pod::Simple, I've been updating the code for my Perl doc browser project (example), adding features to pgTAP, and, erm, planning other stuff. Things will likely be slowish through the holidays, but there should be some interesting stuff trickling out over the coming weeks. Till then, this status post will have to do.

titleA Quick Trip to Alamosa
bodyâZ

Last week, I went on a brief business trip for Kineticode
to Alamosa, Colorado. The client was Adams State College, which is
planning to use Bricolage to manage all of its content. Alamosa is a sleepy
little town of 8,000 people 22 miles north of the border with New Mexico,
situated in the largest valley in the world, I'm told. You can get any kind of
food you want there, as long as it's Mexican food, and the high altitude
(ca. 2300 m) makes the tequila work wonders on one's equilibrium.


Mostly I just worked with our clients, but I did manage to take a couple of
photos, but I did manage to get a couple of photographs with my Nokia 6600. The cool coffeehouse in Alamosa is Milagro's Coffeehouse, but to judge by their sign,
I wasn't sure I wanted what they were selling.




Alamosa has a very small airport. When I flew in on the little prop plane
from Great Lakes Airlines, I was one of two passengers. On the way out (I flew
through Denver), there were five of us. I thought the engine looked cool out
my window, so I turned on my phone (bad David!) and snapped another shot.

Looks like I might be returning to Alamosa soon to do some training. Maybe I'll be
able to get some more pictures; the sunsets are quite lovely there.

Adams State Colloge, where they're implementing a campus-wide content

Departure
bodyàhWe were supposed to leave for France yesterday, but arrived at the airport to find that Lufthansa rescheduled us to leave on Monday (today) instead. United had called us a few weeks ago to alert us about the schedule change: they said the time had changed, not the date. Fuckers. So we got an extra day in Portland. I took Anna to lunch while our friend Tasia took Julie out for a cocktail. That smoothed things over well enough.

So today we're leaving for reals (we hope!). We arrive in Paris tomorrow, November 25th, where we'll (now) spend one night, and then it's on to Rouen, where are taking advantage of a house exchange for the next six weeks. We return to Portland on Jan 4, 2009.

I'm toying with a visit to the Paris Perl Mongueu(r|se)s for their next meeting on December, 10th. I'll need to see what the TGV schedule looks like for a late-night return to Rouen, though. If you're a part of paris.pm, let me know if you'd like me to do some sort of technical talk!

As for the rest of our visit, Julie has started a travel blog for this trip, and I'll likely blog the trip and post photos here. More after we arrive!categoryTravel | France	timestamp

Last week, I posted some photos from Rouen featuring Saint Ouen and le Eglise

At any rate, I‚Äôve gone through about a third of the photos from that trip and have posted them in a Flickr photo set. Keep visiting that set over the next few days as I process more of the photos. Then maybe I‚Äôll get to the shots I‚Äôve made here in Rouen!

bodyàa

I finally got around to posting my photos of the Blue Eiffel Tower on Flickr. The Tower is lit in blue in celebration of the French Presidency of the EU, and will remain blue for another six months or so, from what I understand. Naturally, it got my attention when we last visited Paris, so I spent about an hour and a half shoot it from the Champ de Mars and directly underneath it. It was really quite beautiful, and I especially enjoyed getting some of the details of the decorative Steel of the tower in blue.

Overall, I‚Äôm pretty happy with the results of this shoot. I shot all of the photos with my 50mm F/1.8 ‚ÄúNifty Fifty,‚Äù just because I wanted the speed and sharpness that my 28-105mm zoom just can‚Äôt deliver. Shooting at F/1.8, I was able to get about 1/60 shutter speed most of the time, which allowed me to shoot the whole thing hand-held. But this was at the expense of some detail, I‚Äôm sure, not to mention sharpness. Next time, I‚Äôd like to have a tripod and a wide-angle prime lens. Alas, I‚Äôm not likely to acquire them during this visit. But maybe next time the Eiffel Tower will be red!

titleArrival
body¨<   

Well, we made it. Things went pretty smoothly, all told. The flight was fairly empty, so Anna, at least, was able to lie across two seats and get a few hours of sleep. Julie and I enjoyed the free cognac and dark chocolate. Those European airlines sure know how to take care of their passengers.

The Frankfurt layover was uneventful, if a bit on the long side. We did get a bit confused, going to the wrong terminal only to discover that our connecting flight was in the terminal we arrived in. But it was no big deal; good to move around a bit. The novel part for me was customs. Even though we were flying to France, we went through customs in German. Hello EU!

Arriving in Paris, we fetched our bags from baggage claim and headed for the taxi stand. We were approached my some random guy offering us a ride into town in his taxi for ‚Ç¨80, and then ‚Ç¨50, but I would have none of it. We got a standard tax at the stand allocated for that purpose, and arrived safely at hour hotel 20 minutes later for around ‚Ç¨35. Right, you don't just go along with the aggressive dudes who approach you uninvited in the terminal anymore. Yay progress!

At the hotel, Julie and Anna napped for a bit (it was mid-afternoon, and I wouldn't let them have more than an hour), and then we went out for a bite. The hotel is in a great part of town, just a few blocks from le Tour Eiffel in the 7e arrondissemont. We were tired, though, so just hit a local brasserie, where we had pizza and salad and, for Anna, at the suggestion of our server, french fries (yes, the server called them that; must've assumed we were stupid Americans!). Then we walked around a bit and hit the hay by 8 pm.

Next morning, after a nice light breakfast of rolls, croissants, and home-made jelly, we walked over to the Eiffel Tower for a quick look around. The sky was grey and things a bit wet, but we enjoyed it. Anna rode on a nearby carousel. We walked under the tower, currently undergoing some major maintenance, and watched the boats go by on the river for a bit. Then we grabbed a cab back to the hotel, got our stuff, and headed to the train station.

We were nice and early for the TGV, but the train itself was late. The quai was announced only a few minutes before the scheduled departure and then, once on the train, we waited 45 minutes to actually leave. Once we did leave, however, the trip to Rouen took only a bit more than an hour. Anna fell asleep in Julie's lap while I consumed The New Yorker.

In Rouen, we took another taxi to our house, only a few minutes away, and were warmly greeted by our hosts. For the next 7 hours, Julie struggled with translations, our hosts speaking nary a word of Anglaise, as a parade of friends and neighbors came to call: The friends of our hosts who are also going to be staying our house in Portland, along with their car, which we're borrowing; the graphic designer tenant in the flat next-door, who dropped by with a bag of fresh-baked breads. The two neighbor girls, aged 4 and 6, along with their mother; the baby-sitter and her parents, and probably other people I'm forgetting. Jean-Paul also gave us a quick driven tour of Rouen, including their plot in the local community garden, where we can go pick fresh carrots, brussels sprouts, cabbage, leeks, beets, and other yummy stuff. The town looks nice, too.

After a lovely dinner, Julie and I headed to bed. Anna awoke a few times in the night, but did pretty well overall. Our hosts left at 6:30, and we got up shortly thereafter to start our first full day in our house in Rouen. After breakfasting on the fresh bread, Neufch√¢tel cheese, and home-made jelly, we took the loaned umbrella-stroller and hit the streets to get to know our new town a bit. We're up on a hill north of the downtown area, and getting around with the stroller is a bit of a drag, but the town is quite nice, if cold this time of year (that was expected). Over the next few days, we walked to the open-air market downtown and bought some produce and fromage, hit an incredible children's bookstore on Rue Jeanne d'Arc, and, today, le Musee des Beaux-Arts. Anna has complained a bit, but has been willing to go along with our exploring plans so far. We'll see how things go in the next few days.

The house we're staying in is pretty nice. It's actually three very narrow flats combined into one moderately-sized house. The first floor has an entry way and bathroom, a media room and dining room, and a kitchen and laundry room (no dryer; we hang our laundry here). The second floor has a den/guest bedroom, a large bathroom, and our host's bedroom. The top floor, which is a converted attic, has three bedrooms: ours, Anna's, and a third room with lots of toys in it (the toy room). The size of the space suits us well.

Jet lag hasn't been near the problem we've expected, although J and I have had trouble staying awake between 2pm and 5pm. Anna has awakened a few times each night, but down to only once last night, around 1:15. Hopefully she'll sleep straight through tonight! I (mostly) skipped the nap yesterday and today, and J didn't nap today, so I'm thinking that tomorrow we should be pretty near fully acclimated to the time zone.

Well this has been pretty boring. For a more interesting description of our travels, see Julie's blog, Six Semaines en France. I'll see about blogging here a bit more regularly, too, to try to avoid these long boring posts, though your best luck to learn about our visit to France from me is via my Flicker photostream.

Meanwhile, up next: A visit to Paris Tuesday to Wednesday this week, and planning another visit for December 10th, around a possible visit to the Paris Perl Mongers.

titleMore France Photos
bodyë 

It seems that quite a bit of time went by since my last blog entry before the server downtime. I hadn't realized. Since then, I've posted a bunch more photos from our trip to France. First up, I posted photos from our Christmas in Rouen. Anna was especially happy with the dangly earrings. Click the photo to see the complete set.



Then I went back in time a bit and posted photos from our second stay in Paris. First up was a set from Notre Dame de Paris. I was fortunate to be there on a cloudy day, so that the light coming in the stained glass windows didn't overwhelm the interior light, so that you can actually see some of the interior. I'm especially proud of this photo, it just came together perfectly. Click for the complete set.



The day after Notre Dame, Anna and I went to Cit√© des sciences & de l‚Äôindustrie, a fantastic science and industry museum, featuring Cit√© des Enfants, a hands-on children's museum with interactive, hands-on exhibits. Anna loved it so much that she wanted to go back, which we did in January. Maybe I'll get to those photos sometime in March. ;-)



And finally, there are these shots from Centre Georges Pompidou. It was rainy and wet when we were there (immediately after Notre Dame, in fact), but the weather kind of lended itself to the mood at La Fontaine Stravinsky. And of course, I have more photos of Anna playing in the children's exhibit there.



And finally, just as a bonus, here are some photos I took this morning in Anna's dance and French classes. The light wasn't great (all flourescent), and shooting at ISO 400 at F/1.8 wasn't the best idea, I've decided. I kept only about 10 out of 124 shots. Next time I'll go up to ISO 800 and try to close down the aperture a bit. Wish me luck on that!

I have a lot more photos from France to process, still. I'll post here as I get them on Flickr. It takes a while because Aperture is pretty slow at importing RAW photos from my Canon Rebel XSi, and even slower when I start to make changes to the photos. So it's dragging on, but I'll keep slogging at it. The trick will be for me to try to stay ahead of the curve on photos taken since the trip. I've only got 600 of those. Yikes! Wish me luck!

title8How the Bricolage Summer of Code Projects were Selected
body¢As you may have read, we got quite a
number of applications from students wishing to contribute to Bricolage as
part of Google's Summer of Code initiative. Quite a few of
them were very good. There were eight projects I wanted to accept, but,
Bricolage was allocated only four projects. Of course, this is four more than
we would have had otherwise, and I'm really excited to be working with them
this summer.

The four winning projects are:


  Add Input Channels, by Marshall Roch
  New Sample Document types and templates, by Scott Loyd
  Port Bricolage to Apache 2/mod_perl 2 and Windows, by Sam Strasser
  Port Bricolage to MySQL, by Tamas Mezei


The other projects I wanted to get but could not were:


  Ad Bulk Edik, Bulk Media Upload, and Site Tags, by Andreas Hofmeister
  Element Occurrence Specification, by Christian James Muise
  Add JSP Templating, by Adrian Fernandez
  Update and Modernize the Installer, by Yiannis Valassakis


I am hoping that some of these students might want to work on their
projects, anyway. I've even found other developers to help with the mentoring
of JSP templating (Patrick LeBoutillier with Perl/Java voodo) and
the installer modernization (Sam Tregar
of Matchstick fame). Unfortunately, I've not heard
back from any of them after sending them an invite to participate in the
project. C'est la vie, I guess

The hardest part of the proposal evaluation process was selecting from the
20 proposals to port Bricolage to MySQL. Ultimate, there were four excellent
proposals for this project. Reading the proposals over and over, I couldn't
decide between them. Ultimately, I sent an email to the four top contenders
with the following items for them to reply to:


  Please describe in a line or two your Perl knowledge or experience (if any).
  Please describe in a line or two your MySQL and PostgreSQL knowledge or experience (if any).
  Please describe any previous Bricolage usage experience.
  Please describe any previous Bricolage development experience.
  Please describe any previous Open Source development experience.
  What school do you attend?
  What is your specialty at the school?
  How many years have you attended there?
  How much time do you expect to have for this project?
  Have you applied for any other Summer of Code projects?  If so, which ones?
  Your personal or professional web page URL (if any).
  Would you be willing to collaborate with another developer who might be working on a SQLite port to ensure that your changes can fully inter-operate?
  Please outline your project plan for porting Bricolage to MySQL, including a description of what parts of the Bricolage API, DDLs, installer, and upgrader would need to be modified to complete the project.


For better or for worse, all four applicants responded with detailed answers to my questions. They were all great, and that made it even harder to select just one of them. At this point, there were only a few hours left to rank applicants in Google's SoC Admin Web app, so I figured I had to get more objective‚Äîor at least fool myself into thinking I was.

So I decided to rank each applicant from one to five for each question, and
then add up all of the results and see who came out on top. So now I was
comparing answers to a single question between applicants, and filling in
scores for them in a spreadsheet. As it was, things were still really close; yes, all of the students where that good! Tamas came out on top with a score of 30, two others were tied at 28, and the fourth applicant scored 26. They were close enough that I wanted to review them all one more time, this time paying specific attention to the last item in my questionnaire, the project plan.

Each of the four applicants had taken the time to read the mail lists and had looked at the existing Bricolage code. But there were varying levels of detail and demonstration of knowledge for how to implement the MySQL port, but Tamas did come out slightly ahead on this item, so I gave his proposal the green light.

But in truth, I would have been happy with any one of those four applicants. I was only sorry I had to choose only one! If Google does this again, I think I'll list many more project ideas on the Bricolage Web site, and try to steer people to the mail lists to discuss their ideas before sending them in. Then I might end up with 11 great applications!

titleTKP Permissions Design
bodyùSo, I'm thinking of implementing permissions in the Kinetic Platform differently than they're implemented in Bricolage. Bricolage has a number of fixed permissions: READ, EDIT, RECALL, CREATE, PUBLISH, and DENY. These permissions are cumulative, so that if you have EDIT permission, it implies READ, and if you have CREATE, it implies RECALL, EDIT, and READ.

This design was based on Windows NT permissions (roughly), and has worked reasonably, well, but is annoying for various reasons. The most serious drawback is that it's difficult to understand. I always tell people who need to manage Bricolage permissions to read Bric::Security, and then read six more times. But aside from the impenetrability of the current permissions design, it's also difficult to add new permissions: where should they fit into the hierarchy? This is what happened with RECALL and PUBLISH, which were added in a later version of Bricolage. To this day, it's a bit confusing to some that, with RECALL permission, you can RECALL a story but not CREATE one.

So I'm looking around for other permissions patterns. Unix is nice, in that READ, WRITE, and EXECUTE permissions are all entirely independent, and apply to three classes of objects (file owner, file group, everyone). But Unix only needs to worry about files; Kinetic applications will have many more objects  for which permissions will need to be specified. RT uses discreet permissions with names like AdminQueue, CommentOnTicket, CreateTicket, and StealTicket to be applied to every user or group. This strikes me as somewhat more useful, since the permissions are much more descriptive and can be targeted to particular objects. In fact, the permission names even indicate to what types of objects permissions apply!

So I'm thinking of leaving the cumulative permissions model behind and switching to more descriptive, discreet, and potentially numerous permissions. I'm not, however particularly fond of RT's approach of storing the permissions as strings in the database. Now, I could keep them as numbers, where each permission has its own unique number. This is similar to how Bricolage permissions work. Only I'd have to always use List::MoreUtil's any() function to see if a permission was in a list.

For example, say that an object had permissions with the numbers 1, 2, 5, 8, 12, 49, and 50. If these were stored in an array, then every time I had to check permissions, the can_do() function would have to search through those numbers:


sub can_do {
    my ($self, $to_check) = @_;
    my $perms = $self->perms;
    return any { $_ == $to_check } @$perms;
}


This isn't the most efficient approach, unfortunately. If there are a lot of numbers, and you were always checking one that was towards the end of the list of permissions, it'd always take a long time. So, an alternate approach--one that conveniently works well with discreet permissions--is to use powers of two for the permissions numbers: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and so on. Then, for a given object, these can just be stored in a single number that's created by bit-wise ORing them together: 1 | 2 | 8 | 16. Fortunately, PostgreSQL has a nice aggregate function for this, bit_or(). (I'll have to create my own for SQLite.) Anyway, then the can_do() function becomes much simpler and more efficient:


sub can_do {
    my ($self, $to_check) = @_;
    return $self->perms & $to_check;
}


If the value of $to_check was in the list bit-ORed into their permissions number, it will be returned; otherwise, 0 will be returned. Not bad, eh?

So anyway, I'm soliciting feedback. Are discreet permissions better than cumulative permissions? And if so, are bit-wise ORed numbers the best way to represent an object ACLs?

titleMoving Towards Bricolage 2.0
body≠<Today I've finished just about over two and a half weeks of hacking on
Bricolage. It has been a couple of years since I gave it much attention, but
there was so much good stuff that other people have contributed that, since I
had a little time, it seemed worth it to give it some love. So here's a quick
list of all that I've done in the last two weeks:


  Fixed all reported issues with Bricolage 1.10. Scott Lanning kindly released 1.10.5 yesterday with all of those fixes.
  I integrated the element occurrence branch that Christian Muise had worked on as his 2006 Google Summer of Code project. Christian's project added support for maximum and mininum specfications for subelements in Bricolage, which allows administrators to define how many fields and elements can occur in a story or media document. All I had to do was add a few UI tweaks to support the new fields and their specification in the story profile, and all was ready to go. Oh, and I did have to go back and make the SOAP interface work with the feature, but the only reason it never did was lazy hacking of the SOAP interface (way before Christian's time). Nice work, Christian, and thank you for your contribution!
  I fixed a few bugs with Arsu Andrei's port of Bricolage to MySQL, which was his 2006 Google Summer of Code project. Arsu did a terrific job with the port, with only a few minor things missed that he likely could not have caught anyway. This work had already been merged into the trunk. Thanks Arsu!
  I fixed a bunch of bugs from Marshall Roch's AJAXification of Bricolage, carried out during his 2006 Google Summer of Code project. Marshall actually did a lot more stuff than he'd planned, as it all went quite smoothly. I found only a few minor oversights that I was able to eaily address. This work represents the single most visible change to how users user Bricolage since we launched the probject back in 2001. Editing stories, in particular, is now a lot cleaner, with far fewer page loads. Thanks a million, Marshall!
  I completed the work started by Chris Heiland of the University of Washington, Bothell, and Scott Lanning of the World Health Organization to port Bricolage to Apache 2. They really did most of the hard work, and I just spent several days integrating everything, making sure all the features work, and updating the installer to handle differences in configuration. I thought this would take me a day or two, but it actually took the better part of a week! So much has changed, but in truth Bricolage is now better for running on mod_perl 2. Expect to see Apache 2 bet the recommended platform for Bricolage in a release in the near future.
  I integrated a number of patches from Brian Smith of Gossamer Threads to allow the installer to be run as a non-root user. The key here is if the installer has to become the database super user, which is required for ident authentication, and of course whether files are to be installed somewhere on the system requiring super user access. This work is not done, yet, as make upgrade and make uninstall are not quite there yet. But we're getting there, and it should be all done in time for 2.0, thanks to Brian.
  I added support for a whole slew of environment variables to the installer. Now you can set environment variables to override default settings for installation parameters, such as choice of RDBMS, Apache, location of an SSL cert and key, whether to support SLL, and lots of other stuff, besides. This is all documented in the Quick Installation Instructions section of Bric::Admin/INSTALL.
  I fully tested and fixed a lot of bugs leftover from making the installer database- and Apache-neutral. Now all of these commands should work perfectly:
    
      make
      make cpan
      make test
      make install
      make devtest
      make clone
      make uninstall
    
  
  I improved the DHTML functionality of the Add More widget, which is used to add contact information to users and contributors, rules to alert types, and extensions to media types. I think it's pretty slick, now! This was built on Marshall's AJAX work.


All of these changes have been integrated into the Bricolage trunk and I've pushed out a developer release today. Please do check out all the goodness on a test box and send feedback or file bug reports! There are only a couple of other features waiting to go into Bricolage before we start the release candidate process. And, oh yeah, tht title of this blog post? It's not a lie. The next production release of Bricolage, based on all this work, will be Bricolage 2.0. Enough of the features we'd planned for Bricolage lo these many years ago are in the trunk that the new version number is warranted. I for one will be thrilled to see 2.0 ship in time for OSCON.

And in case it isn't already clear, many thanks to the Google Summer of Code and participating students for the great contributions! This release would not have been possible without them.

Also in the news today, the Bricolage server has been replaced! The new server, which hosts the Web site, the wiki and the instance of Bricolage used to manage the site itself, is graciously provided by the kind folks at Gossamer Threads. The server is Gossamer Threads's way of giving back to the Bricolage community as they prepare to launch a hosted Bricolage solution. Thaks GT!

The old Bricolage server was provided by pair Networds for the last five years. I'd just like to thank pair for the generous five-year loan of that box, which helped provided infrastructure for both Bricolage and Kineticode. Thank you, pair!

And with that, I'm going heads-down on some other projects. I'll pop back up to make sure that Bricolage 2.0 is released in a few months, but otherwise, I'm on to other things again for a while. Watch this space for details!

title#Why Bricolage documents have UUIDs
bodyôYSome time ago, I decided that all objects in Bricolage 2 would have Universally Unique Identifiers, also known as UUIDs. A UUID is guaranteed to be universally unique, never to be generated again by the same or any other system now or in the future. As anyone using Bricolage knows, all stories and media already have IDs, so why have UUIDs, as well? How does their purpose differ?

Well, first of all, the existing IDs are not really identifiers. What they are, instead, are primary keys. However, a primary key should ideally be a surrogate key, meaning that it has no other meaning outside of identifying a single database row. Sometimes you can use an intelligent key, meaning an attribute of the object being stored (such as a user login), for the primary key. But the problem with intelligent keys is that, should their values ever be changed (say a user's name changes and company login name conventions dictate that the login must be changed to represent the new name), all foreign key references will be broken. It is therefore easier, and more agile, to use a surrogate key with no inherent meaning to the object with which it is associated.

Now, once you start using an object ID that is actually a surrogate key for something other than identifying a row in a database, you add new meaning to it. At that point, it is no longer a surrogate. In Bricolage, this comes up when users want to use IDs for story URIs. At that point, the ID is no longer just a primary key identifying a database row, but it is also an object identifier. What happens if that identifier changes? Well, in general, it won't, so you'd be safe to use it for both purposes. But sometimes it does.

When? Some Bricolage users have decided to upgrade to a newer version of Bricolage by setting up the new version on a different server, exporting their data from the old server, and then importing it into the new. This can work reasonably well, but it has what may be an unintended side-effect for those who use the ID in the URI: all objects will get new primary keys when they're inserted into the new system.

What? you cry! Yes, that's right. Because the ID is used solely to identify a row in a database, when you insert an existing object into a new database, it gets stored in a new row. It therefore gets a new ID, and your URIs suddenly start to 404. Ouch.

The solution to this problem is to give Bricolage objects a universally unique identifier that can work anywhere, that means nothing other than this is a unique identifier for this object, and which are guaranteed not to change when you move an object from one system to another. Happily, the UUID standard exists for just this sort of thing. You are free to use a story's UUID in its URI without having to worry about it ever changing. IDs may change, but you don't have to worry about those.

For these reason, the forthcoming Bricolage 1.10.0 has added UUIDs to story and media objects, these being the objects most in need of UUIDs, and they are available for use in URIs. Looking to the future, the Kinetic Platform, currently under development and the platform to which Bricolage 2.0 will be ported, never exposes the primary key IDs at all. There is only the UUID for referencing objects externally. I judge this a very good thing.

title#Bricolage Now has PHP 5 Templating
body¬#Well, I've finally gone and done it. I've released Bricolage 1.9.0, the first development release towards 1.10.0, which I plan to get out sometime next month. Among the new features in this release that I'm most excited about are a revamped UI, LDAP authentication, and PHP 5 templating support.

The new UI is really nice. Marshall Roch ported it all to XHTML 1.0 strict plus CSS. All the layout is done with CSS now, instead of the old 1999-era table layouts we had before. The result is much smaller page loads, sometimes up to 70% smaller, Marshall tells me, and therefore much faster loads. Playing around with the new version (now powering the Kineticode and Bricolage Web sites, I do indeed find it to be a lot zippier. Couple the new UI with the new mod_gzip support and static Mason components, and things just perk right along! Oh, and the expandable interfaces for both lists of objects and for editing interfaces is very nice, indeed. Thank you Marshall for the great work!

Kineticode added the LDAP authentication support. We've been using a patch for it against 1.8.x for our internal version of Bricolage and it works great. Now we authenticate off of an OpenLDAP server, using the same usernames and passwords we use for our email, Subversion, and RT servers. The configuration is simple, via bricolage.conf directives, and you can even limit users who authenticate to members of a particular LDAP group. Users must exist in Bricolage, and if LDAP authentication fails, you can fall back on Bricolage's internal authentication. I'm hoping that the LDAP support goes a long way towards attracting more enterprise customers with single sign-on requirements.

And finally‚Äîyes, you heard right‚ÄîBricolage now supports PHP 5 templating in addition to the existing Perl-based templating architectures (Mason, Template Toolkit, and HTML::Template). So how did we add PHP 5 templating to a mod_perl application? Easy: we hired George Schlossnagle of Omni TI to write PHP::Interpreter, an embedded PHP 5 interpreter. Now anyone can natively execute PHP 5 code from a Perl application. Not only that, but the PHP 5 code can reach back into the Perl interpreter to use Perl modules and objects! Here's an example that I like to show off to the PHP crowd:


<?php
  $perl = Perl::getInstance();
  $perl->eval("use DBI");
  $perl->eval("use DateTime");
  $dbh = $perl->call("DBI::connect", "DBI", "dbi:SQLite:dbname=dbfile");
  $dbh->do("CREATE TABLE foo (bar TEXT, time DATETIME)");
  $now = $perl->call("DateTime::now", "DateTime");
  $ins = $dbh->prepare("INSERT INTO foo VALUES (?, ?)");
  $ins->execute("This is a test", $now);
  $sel = $dbh->prepare("SELECT bar, time FROM foo");
  $sel->execute();
  $a = array("foo", "bar");
  foreach ($sel->fetch() as $val) {
      echo "$val\n";
  }
  $sel->finish();
  $dbh->do("DROP TABLE foo");
  $dbh->disconnect();
?>


Note that George plans to add convenience methods to load Perl modules and call Perl class methods. Now, to execute this code from Perl, all you have to do is write a little script, call it pphp, like so:


use strict;
use PHP::Interpreter;
my $php = PHP::Interpreter->new;
$php->include(shift);


Then just execute your PHP code with the script: pphp try.php. Yes, this does work! For years, when I've run across a PHP coder who wanted to try to tell me that PHP was better than Perl, I always had a one-word reply that left him cursing and conceding defeat: CPAN. Well no more. Now PHP hackers can use any module on CPAN, too!

And as for Bricolage, the integration of PHP 5 templating is completely transparent. Users just write PHP 5 templates instead of Mason templates and that's it! For example, this is a fairly common style Bricolage Mason template:


<%perl>;
for my $e ($element->get_elements(qw(header para _pull_quote_))) {
    my $kn = $e->get_key_name;
    if ($kn eq "para") {
        $m->print("<p>", $e->get_data, "</p>\n");
    } elsif ($kn eq "header") {
        # Test sdisplay_element() on a field.
        $m->print("<h3>", $burner->sdisplay_element($e), "</h3>\n");
    } elsif ($kn eq "_pull_quote_" && $e->get_object_order > 1) {
        # Test sdisplay_element() on a container.
        $m->print($burner->sdisplay_element($e));
    } else {
        # Test display_element().
        $burner->display_element($e);
    }
}
$burner->display_pages("_page_");
</%perl>


The same template in PHP 5 looks like this:


<?php
# Convenience variables.
$story   = $BRIC["story"];
$element = $BRIC["element"];
$burner  = $BRIC["burner"];
foreach ($element->get_elements("header", "para", "_pull_quote_") as $e) {
    $kn = $e->get_key_name();
    if ($kn == "para") {
        echo "<p>", $e->get_data(), "</p>\n";
    } else if ($kn == "header") {
        # Test sdisplay_element() on a field.
        echo "<h3>", $burner->sdisplay_element($e), "</h3>\n";
    } else if ($kn == "_pull_quote_" && $e->get_object_order() > 1) {
        # Test sdisplay_element() on a container.
        echo $burner->sdisplay_element($e);
    } else {
        # Test display_element().
        $burner->display_element($e);
    }
}
$burner->display_pages("_page_");
?>


Yes, you are seeing virtually the same thing. But this is just a simple template from Bricolage's test suite. The advantage is that PHP 5 coders who are familiar with all the ins and outs of PHP 5 can just jump in an get started writing Bricolage templates without having to learn any Perl! The Bricolage objects have exactly the same API as they do in Perl, because they are exactly the same objects! So everyone uses the same API documentation for the same tasks. The only issue I've noticed so far is that PHP 5 does not yet have proper Unicode support. Since all content in Bricolage is stored as UTF-8, this means that the PHP 5 templates must treat it as binary data. But this is okay as long as templaters use the mb_* PHP 5 functions to parse text.

Overall I'm very excited about this, and hope that it helps Bricolage to reach a whole new community of users. I'd like to thank Portugal Telecom‚ÄîSAPO.pt for sponsoring the development of PHP::Interpreter and its integration into Bricolage. I believe that they've really done the Bricolage community a great service, and I hope that the Perl and PHP communities likewise benefit from the integration possible with PHP::Interpreter.

And just so that the other templating architectures don't feel left out, here is how the above template looks in Template Toolkit:


[% FOREACH e = element.get_elements("header", "para", "_pull_quote_") %]
    [% kn = e.get_key_name %]
    [% IF kn == "para" %]
<p>[% e.get_data %]</p>
    [% ELSIF kn == "header" %]
        [% # display_element() should just return a value. %]
<h3>[% burner.display_element(e) %]</h3>
    [% ELSIF kn == "_pull_quote_" && e.get_object_order > 1 %]
        [% PERL %]
          # There is no sdisplay_element() in the TT burner, but we"ll just
          # Play with it, anyway.
          print $stash->get("burner")->display_element($stash->get("e"));
        [% END %]
    [% ELSE %]
        [% # Test display_element(). %]
        [% burner.display_element(e) %]
    [% END %]
[% END %]
[% burner.display_pages("_page_") %]


And here it is in HTML::Template:


<tmpl_if _page__loop>
<tmpl_loop _page__loop>
<tmpl_include name="testing/sub/util.tmpl">
<tmpl_var _page_>
<tmpl_var page_break>
</tmpl_loop>
<tmpl_else>
<tmpl_include name="testing/sub/util.tmpl">
</tmpl_if>


I had to use the utility template with HTML::Template to get it to work right, don't ask why. It looks like this:


<tmpl_loop element_loop>
<tmpl_if is_para>
<p><tmpl_var para></p>
</tmpl_if>
<tmpl_if is_header>
<h3><tmpl_var header></h3>
</tmpl_if>
<tmpl_if is__pull_quote_>
<tmpl_var _pull_quote_>
</tmpl_if>
</tmpl_loop>


These templates come from the Bricolage test suite, where until this release, there were never any template tests before. So you can see that the PHP 5 templating initiative has had major benefits for the stability of Bricolage, too. Now that I've really worked with all four templating architectures in Bricolage, I can now say that my preference for which to do goes in this order:


  Mason, because of its killer autohandler and inheritance architecture
  PHP 5 or Template Toolkit are tied for second place
  HTML::Template


In truth, all four are capable and have access to the entire Bricolage API so that they can output anything. So what are you waiting for? Download Bricolage and give it a try!

titleBricolage 2.0 Drops
body¢"Bricolage 2.0 was released today. This is a pretty big deal, and a long time coming. The most important changes, from my point of view, are:


Revamped UI. As a 2006 Google Summer of Code project, Marshall Roch added a slew of Ajaxy goodness to the Bricolage UI. It used to be that, to dig down into a document, you needed to click through reloads for every level. Now the entire structure of a document is available on a single screen, and digging down takes place in situ. This means faster, easier document editing.

There are other niceties too, thanks to Marshall, like as-you-type autocompletion of category URIs and keywords, popups for associating related documents, dynamic field generation for document keywords and user contacts, and animated workflow actions for moving, deleting, and publishing documents.

These changes mark a truly impressive improvement in usability for the people who use Bricolage every day, and will by far be the most welcome change for our users.
Finer content control. Thanks to another 2006 Google Summer of Code project, Christian Muise implemented what we call ‚Äúelement occurrence specification.‚Äù Bricolage document structure is controlled by administrators creating document types with hierarchies of elements. Elements may contain fields‚Äîthe types and value of which may also be specified (text, textarea, select list, etc.)‚Äîand other elements.

In previous versions of Bricolage, if an element was a subelement of a document, one could add any number of that element to a document. Fields were a bit more controlled: you could only say whether one or many instances of a field were allowed in a given element.

Element occurrence specification allows administrators to have much finer control over document elements by specifying the minimum and maximum number of instances of an element or field may occur. For example, one can say that a document may have only one instance of a field, or must have three, or may have between 3 and 5, or may have at least 3, or may have any number, including none.

Bret Dawson put it really well in the Bricolage 2.0 Changes:


  Want every book review you publish to contain at least three but no more than 10 ISBN numbers? Want exactly four pull-quotes in every article? You can do that in Bricolage 2.

MySQL support. This, too, was a 2006 Google Summer of Code project, by Andrei Arsu. Yes, you can run Bricolage 2.0 on MySQL 5.0 if you want. This was a pretty big project, and I‚Äôm surprisingly pleased at how well it works now that all the kinks have been worked out (special thanks to Waldo Jaquith for being brave (foolish?) enough to start a Bricolage project on MySQL and thus to shake out some bugs).
Apache 2 support. This was started quite some time ago by Chris Heiland, hacked on later by Scott Lanning, and finally finished by yours truly. I look forward to dumping Apache 1 in the future.


There‚Äôs other stuff, too, lots of little things and not-so-little things. Altogether they go a long way toward making Bricolage better.

It‚Äôs been quite a day, and I‚Äôm glad to have it out the door. Four years is a long time to wait for a major release, and it happened not because of me, but thanks to the work of others who have picked up the gauntlet. Huge thanks especially to:


The Google Summer of Code, especially the 2006 projects (yes, we finally shipped them!).
Phillip Smith, who spearheaded the terrific new bricolagecms.org design, updated the Bricolage 2.0 context-sensitive help, and generally pushed forward the Bricolage marketing and social media agenda (follow @bricolagecms!).
Bret Dawson, who has been writing release announcments and put together the awesomely human version of the Bricolage 2.0 change log, as well as the public announcement.
Matt Rolf, who wrote the Bricolage 2.0 press release and provided a huge load of various HTML and CSS fixes to Bricolage 2.0.
Marshall Roch, who started hacking on Bricolage in high school, worked through two summers of code, and made the UI what it is today.
Alex Krohn, who provides hosting for the Bricolage site via his Bricolage hosting product at Gossamer Threads, helped to diagnose and fix a number of important bugs, and has just been an all around great technical resource.


Many others provided feedback, patches, and bug reports, and I appreciate all the help. I hope to see you all for Bricolage 2.2!

title"Bricolage GSoC Projects Completed
body≠/I'm very pleased to report that the Google Summer of Code Bricolage
projects have all been successfully completed. The contributions of the three
Summer of Coders, Marshall Roch, Christian Muise, and Andrei Arsu, will be
included in the next major release of Bricolage. On behalf of the Bricolage
community, like to extend my gratitude to Google for sponsoring these three
excellent students to dramatically improve the interface, capabilities, and
compatibility of Bricolage.

So what got done? Here's a rundown:


  
    Marshall Roch added many slick Ajax features to Bricolage. The story
      profile now manages the editing of all elements and subelements in a
      single screen, with no loading of a separate screen for subelements. You
      can navigate to subelements by clicking on a tree structure right in the
      story profile. Subelements more than three levels down will be loaded
      dynamically when you get to them. You can also drag and drop fields and
      elements to reorder them.

    Other stuff that Marshall Ajaxified:
    
      Document and category keyword editing
      Document category association
      Document output channel associations
      Organizations in the source profile
      The Add More sections of the user, contributor, media
      type, and alert type profiles
      Roles in the contributor profile
      Assets on desks and My Workspace
    

    Marshall worked hard to integrate more interactive features into this
      2000-era application, and I, for one, appreciate his hard work. Great
      job, Marshall!
  

  
    Christian Muise added support for an occurrence specification to
      element types and field types. That means that when you make an element
      type a subelement of another element type, you can specify the minimum
      and/or maximum number of times that it can be a subelement. So when an
      element of the parent type is created, it will automatically add the
      minimum number of instances of a subelement specified for that parent
      type. This will allow an entire element tree to be pre-populated as soon
      as you create a new story or media document. Leaving the min and max
      occurrence set to 0 (zero) maintains the old behavior (no required
      subelements and an unlimited number can be added).

    Christian did the same for field types, too. The old Required
      and Repeatable attributes are gone; now you just specify a
      minimum number to require that number of instances of a field, and a
      maximum number to limit the number of instances. Together with the
      element type occurrence specification, this functionality allows
      Bricolage administrators to have a lot more control over the structure
      of the documents created by editors.

    Christian worked hard to complete this project, despite other huge
      demands on his time this summer (including a full-time job!). But thanks
      to his active participation on the developer mail list and his
      willingness to ask questions of his mentor, Scott Lanning, and myself,
      he overcame all obstacles to implement these features. He even wrote a
      number of new tests to ensure that it works properly and will continue
      to do so for the foreseeable future.

    Excellent work, Christian, and thank you so much for your
      contribution!
  

  
    Andrei Arsu ported Bricolage to MySQL 5. Bricolage has always run on
      PostgreSQL and used a number of PostgreSQL-specific features to ensure
      that it ran properly and well. Andrei took these on, converting the
      existing PostgreSQL DDL files to work on MySQL, figuring out how to
      convince MySQL to work with some of their idiosyncrasies, and writing
      compatibility functions in the MySQL driver and upgrade module so that
      things should largely just work. As a result, for the first time
      ever, you can now build and run Bricolage on MySQL. Can compatibility
      with other databases be far behind?

    Andrei picked up Perl very quickly during this project, and was able to
      understand how such horrible code as the Bricolage installer worked
      without running screaming from the project. His code was well-written
      and his approaches to compatibility flexible and scalable. Well done,
      Andrei!
  


Future Plans

The next tasks toward getting this code integrated and released are as
follows:


  Andrei will merge his MySQL port into subversion trunk. This should
  actually be fairly straight-forward.

  Marshall will merge his Ajaxification work into trunk. I don't expect
  that there will be any conflicts with Andrei's work, as the two projects
  were orthogonal.

  Christian will merge his occurrence specification work into trunk.
  This will require that he work some with Andrei to ensure that his changes to
  the PostgreSQL DDLs are propagated to the new MySQL DDLS. He will also then
  need to work with Marshall to make sure that the occurrence specification
  works properly with the Ajaxified UI.


Once these tasks have been completed, we'll be ready to release a
development version of Bricolage with all three of these major improvements.
The development release will allow members of the Bricolage community to start
to play with the new features, report bugs, and make further suggestions for
improvement. Expect the release sometime in the next six weeks or so.

Again, my thanks to Marshall, Christian, and Andrei for their hard work
this summer, and for all that they have contributed to the Bricolage community
and project. I hope that each will remain involved in the community, not only
to support the features they've added, but to work with other members of the
community to add new features, help newbies, and generally to spread the
word.

titleBricolage 1.8.6 Released
bodyûjThe Bricolage development team is pleased to announce the release of
Bricolage 1.8.6. This maintenance release addresses numerous minor issues in
Bricolage 1.8.5 and adds a number of improvements, including SOAP, document
expiration, and bric_queued fixes. The most important changes
include:

Improvements


Added JavaScript code to validate that the username in the user profile does not have leading or trailing spaces.
[David]

Events in the event log are now returned (and displayed) in reverse
chronological order. [David]

The SOAP server now uses a user's template sandbox when executing previews
(such as with bric_soap --to-preview workflow publish). Reported
by Marshall. [David]

Bric::Biz::Workflow now caches calls to allowed_desks(). This
will allow desks to render much Faster, since most assets on a desk
will list the same desks in the Move to select lists. [David]

When the PUBLISH_RELATED_ASSETS bricolage.conf
directive is enabled, aliases are now also republished. Only aliases that have
previously been published will be republished, and only the last published
version will be republished, rather than any versions created since the last
publish. Suggested by Serge Sozonoff. [David]

A story or media document published with an expire date earlier than the
scheduled publish time no longer bothers with the publish but just expires the
story or media document. [David]

Media documents without an associated media file will no longer be
displayed in the search results when attempting to relate a media document to
an element. Reported by Adam Rinehart. [David]


Bug Fixes


Form validation and group management now properly work in the user
profile. [David]

The SFTP mover now works with bric_queued. [David]

Cloned stories now properly set the published_version
attribute to undef rather than the value of the original story,
thus preventing the clone from having a published version number greater than
its current version number. Reported by Nate Perry-Thistle and Joshua
Edelstein. [David and Nate Perry-Thistle]

When a category is added to a story that creates a URI conflict, the new
category does not remain associated with the story in the story profile after
the conflict error has been thrown. Reported by Paul Orrock. [David]

Contributor groups created in the contributor profile are no longer
missing from the contributor manager search interface. Reported by Rachel
Murray and Scott. [David]

The favicon.ico works again. [David]

Stories are now properly expired when
the BRIC_QUEUED bricolage.conf directive is enabled.
Reported by Scott. [David]

When a template is checked out of the library and then the checkout is
canceled, it is no longer left on the desk it was moved into upon the
checkout, but properly reshelved. Reported by Marshall. [David]

Super Bulk Edit now works for media as well as stories. Reported by Scott.
[David]

When a template is moved to a new category, the old version of the
template is undeployed when the new version is deployed to the new category.
The versions in the sandbox are properly synced, as well.

titleBricolage 1.8.5 Released
body≠"The Bricolage development team is pleased to announce the release of
Bricolage 1.8.5. This maintenance release addresses a number of issues in
Bricolage 1.8.3 and adds a number of improvements (there was no announcement
for the short-lived 1.8.4 release). The SOAP server in particular sees
improvements in this release, with improved character set support; better
support for related stories and media using URIs in addition to IDs; and as
support for top-level element relations. Issues with the ordering of story
elements have also been corrected, as well as errors when attempting to revert
a story or media document or template. Here are the other highlights of this
release:

Improvements


Added Linux startup script contrib/start_scripts/linux.
[David]

Related story and media elements managed through the SOAP server can now
use a combination of URI and site ID to identify related assets in addition to
the existing approach of using story and media IDs. [David]

A list of subelements is now less likely to mysteriously become out of
order and thus lead to strange action-at-a-distance errors. And even if they
do become out of order, the error message will be more appropriate
(Warning! State inconsistent instead of Can't call method
"get_name" on an undefined value). Reported by Curtis Poe.
[David]

The SOAP media interface now supports creating relationships between the
media documents elements and other story and media documents, just like the
SOAP story interface does. [David]

The SOAP interface now supports Related stories and media on story type
and media type elements just as in the UI. This involved the somewhat hackish
necessity for including the related_story_id
and related_media_id (or related_story_uri
and related_media_uri) attributes in the elements XML element,
but it does the trick. [David]


Bug Fixes


Calls to publish documents via SOAP will no longer fail if
the published_version attribute is not specified and the document
to be published has never been published before. [David]

The Bricolage virtual FTP server will no longer fail to start if Template
Toolkit is installed but its version number is less than 2.14. Reported by
Adam Rinehart. [David]

Stories and Media created or updated via the SOAP interface will now
associate contributors of the appropriate type, instead of All
Contributors. [Scott & David]

Deleting an element that has a template no longer causes an error. Thanks
to Susan for the spot! [David]

Eliminated encoding errors when using the SOAP interface to output
stories, media, or templates with wide characters. Reported by Scott Lanning.
[David]

Reverting (stories, media, templates) no longer gives an error. Reported
by Simon Wilcox, Rachel Murray, and others. [David]

Publishing a published version of a document that has a later version in
workflow will no longer cause that later version to be mysteriously removed
from workflow. This could be caused by passing a document looked up using
the published_version to list()
to $burner->publish_another in a template. [David]

The SOAP server story and media interfaces now support elements that
contain both related stories and media, rather than one or the other.
[David]

Attempting to preview a story or media document currently checked out to
another user no longer causes an error. Reported by Paul Orrock. [David]

Custom fields with default values now have their values included when they
are added to stories and media. Thanks to Clare Parkinson for the spot!
[David]

The bric_queued script now requires a username and password
and will authenticate the user. This user will then be used for logging
events. All events logged when a job is run via the UI are now also logged
by bric_queued. [Mark and David]

Preview redirections now use the protocol setting of the preview output
channel if it‚Äôs available, and falls back on using http:// when
it‚Äôs not, instead of using the hard-coded http://. Thanks to
Martin Bacovsky for the spot! [David]

The has_keyword() method in the Business class (from which
the story and media classes inherit) now works. Thanks to Clare Parkinson for
the spot! [David]

Clicking a link in the left-side navigation after the session has expired
now causes the whole window to show the login form, rather than it showing
inside the nav frame, which was useless. [Marshall]

The JavaScript that validates form contents once again works with
htmlArea, provided htmlArea itself is patched. See the relevant htmlArea
bug report for the patch. As of this writing, you must run the version of
htmlArea in CVS. [David & Marshall]

The JavaScript that handles the double list manager has been vastly
optimized. It should now be able to better handle large lists, such as a list
of thousands of categories. Reported by Scott. [Marshall]

Uploading a new image to a media document with a different media type than
the previous image no longer causes an Imager error. [David]

titleBricolage 1.8.3 Released
body±7The Bricolage development team is pleased to announce the release of Bricolage
1.8.3. This maintenance release addresses a number of issues in Bricolage
1.8.2. The most important changes eliminate or greatly reduce the number of
deadlocks caused during bulk publishes of many documents. Other changes
include new contributed scripts for importing contributors and for generating
thumbnail images, Russian localization, and various fixes for database
transaction, template formatting, and various user interface fixes. Here are
the other highlights of this release:

Improvements


Added contrib/thumbnails/precreate-thumbs.pl script to pre-create
thumbnails from images. Useful for upgraders. [Scott]

Added contrib/bric_import_contribs to import contributors from a
tab-delimited file. Development by Kineticode, sponsored by the RAND
Corporation. [David]

Added the published_version parameter to
the list() methods of the story, media, and template
classes. This parameter forces the search to return the versions of the assets
as they were last published, rather than the most recent version. This will be
most useful to those looking up other documents in templates and publishing
them, as a way of avoiding pulling documents out from other anyone who might
have them checked out! [David]

All publishing and distribution jobs are now executed in their own
transactions when they are triggered by the user interface. This is to reduce
the chances of a deadlock between long-running publishing
transactions. [David]

Optimized SQL queries for key names or that order by string values to use
indexes in the list() and list_ids() methods of the
story, media, and template classes. [David]

Added Russian localization.
[Sergey Samoilenko].

Changed the foreign keys in the story, media, and formatting (template)
tables so that DELETEs do not cascade, but are restricted. This
means that before deleting any source, element, site, workflow, or other
related object that has a foreign key reference in an asset table, those rows
must be deleted. Otherwise, PostgreSQL will throw an exception. Hopefully,
this will put a stop to the mysterious but very rare disappearance of stories
from Bricolage. [David]

A call to $burner->burn_another in a template that passes
in a date/time string in the future now causes a publish job to be scheduled
for that time, rather than immediate burning the document and then scheduling
the distribution to take place in the future. Reported by Ashlee
Caul. [David]

Changing the sort order of a list of items in a search interface now
properly reverses the entire collection of object over the pages, rather than
just the objects for the current page. Thanks to Marshall for the spot!
[David]


Bug Fixes


Publishing stories not in workflow via the SOAP server works again.
[David]

The Burner object‚Äôs encoding attribute is now setable
as well as readable. [David]

The category browser works again. [David]

Fixed Media Upload bug where the full local path was being used, by adding
a winxp key to Bric::Util::Trans::FS to account for an update to
HTTP::BrowserDetect. [Mark Kennedy]

Instances of a required custom field in story elements is no longer
required once it has been deleted from the element definition in the element
manager. Reported by Rod Taylor. [David]

A false value passed to the checked_out parameter of
the list() and list_ids() methods of the story,
media, and template (formatting) classes now properly returns only objects or
IDs for assets that are not checked out. [David]

The cover date select widget now works properly in the clone interface
when a non-ISO style date preference is selected. Thanks to Susan G. for the
spot! [David]

Sorting templates based on Asset Type (Element) no longer causes an
error. [David]

Fixed a number of the callbacks in the story, media, and template profiles
so that they didn‚Äôt clear out the session before other callbacks were
done with it. Most often seen as the error Can‚Äôt call
method get_tiles on an undefined value in the media profile,
especially with IE/Windows (for some unknown reason). Reported by Ed
Stevenson. [David]

Fixed typo in clone page that caused all output channels to be listed
rather than only those associated with the element itself. [Scott]

Fixed double listing of the All group in the group membership
double list manager. [Christian Hauser]

Image buttons now correctly execute the onsubmit() method for
forms that define an onsubmit attribute. This means that, among
other things, changes to a group profile will persist when you click
the Permissions button. [David]

Simple search now works when it is selected when the Default Search
preference is set to Advanced. Reported by Marshall Roch. [David]

Multiple alert types set up to trigger alerts for the same event will now
all properly execute. Thanks to Christian Hauser for the spot! [David]

Publishing stories or media via SOAP with the published_only
parameter (--published-only for bric_republish) now
correctly republishes the published versions of documents even if the current
version is in workflow. Reported by Adam Rinehart. [David]

Users granted a permission greater than READ to the members of the All
Users group no longer get such permission to any members of the Global
Admins group unless they have specifically been granted such permission to
the members of the Global Admins group. Thanks to Marshall Roch for the
spot! [David]

titleBricolage 1.8.1 Released
body≠The Bricolage development team is pleased to announce the release of Bricolage 1.8.1.
This maintenance release address a number of issues in Bricolage 1.8.0.
Here are the highlights:

Improvements


More complete Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese
localizations. Also, the Mandarin localization now simply inherits from the
Traditional Chinese localization.

make clone now copies the lib directory and all of the bin scripts from the target to the clone,
rather than from the sources.
This allows any changes that have been made to scripts and classes to be properly cloned.

When installing Bricolage,
it will now allow you to proceed if the database already exists by asking if you want to create the Bricolage tables in the existing database.
Suggested by Mark Fournier and Marshall Roch.

The installer is now a bit smarter in how it handles loading the
log_config (or config_log, as the case may be)
module.

Added language-specific style sheets.
This is especially useful for right-to-left languages or for languages that require special fonts.

The New Alias search interface now displays thumbnails when searching for media documents to alias and the USE_THUMBNAILS bricolage.conf directive is enabled.

Aliases can now be made to documents within the same site.

The SOAP interface for importing and exporting elements now properly has key_name XML elements instead of name XML elements.
The changes are backwards compatible with XML exported from Bricolage 1.8.0 servers,
however.

Added move() method to the virtual FTP interface.
This means that to deploy a template,
rather than having to rename it locally to append .deploy
one can simply move in FTP to its new name with .deploy on appended to the new name.

Document expirations are now somewhat more intelligent.
Rather than just scheduling an expiration job only if there is an expiration date the first time a document is published,
Bricolage will now always schedule an expiration job for a document provided that one does not already exist (scheduled or completed) for the same time and for one of the file resources for the document.
This should allow people to more easily and arbitrarily expire content whenever necessary.

Burner notes now persist for all sub burns (triggered by publish_another() and preview_another() in a single burn.

Added ability to create and manage groups of objects for several different types of objects.
Also added the ability manage group membership within the administrative profiles for those objects.
This change makes it possible to give users permission to administer subsets of objects.
The new groupable objects are:


Preferences

Groups

Alert Types

Element Types

Keywords

Contributors




Alert rules are now evaluated within a safe compartment (using Safe.pm) to prevent security exploits.

The Bulk Publish admin tool is no longer limited to use only by members of the Global Admins group.
Now anyone can use it.
All one needs is READ permission to the categories of stories,
and PUBLISH permission to the stories and media documents to be published.


Bug Fixes


Eliminated Bareword "ENABLE_HTMLAREA" not allowed while "strict subs" in use warning that prevented startup for some installations.

Changes made to user or contributor contacts without changing any other part of the user or contributor object are now properly saved.

The upgrade to 1.8.0 now correctly updates story URIs that use the URI Suffix of an output channel instead of using the URI Prefix twice.

Aliases of Image,
Audio,
or Video media documents no longer remain stuck on desks.

Related media and story subelements of media documents now work properly.

Calls to preview_another() in Bric::Util::Burner will now use any templates in the current user's sandbox and properly burn them to the preview root rather than to the staging root used for publishing.

Contributor fields for roles other than the default role now properly store and retain their values.

The virtual FTP server now properly checks out templates when a template is uploaded and is already in workflow.

Uploading a non-existent template via the virtual FTP server now correctly creates a new template.
The type of template depends on the name of the template being uploaded,
and for element templates,
on whether there is an element with the appropriate key name.
The user must have CREATE permission to All Templates or to the start desk in the first template workflow in the relevant site.

Reverting a document or template to the current version number now properly reverts all changes to the time the user checked out the document or template.
Reversion is also a bit more efficient in how it looks up the previous version in the database.

The SOAP server now rolls back any changes whenever an error is thrown.
This prevents problems when a few objects are created or updated before an exception is thrown.
Now any error will cause the entire SOAP request to fail.
Thanks to Neal Sofge for the spot!

titleBricolage 1.8.2 Released
bodyØ(The Bricolage development team is pleased to announce the release of Bricolage 1.8.2.
This maintenance release addresses quite a large number of issues in Bricolage 1.8.1.
The most important changes were to enhance Unicode support in Bricolage.
Bricolage now internally handles all text content as UTF-8 strings,
thus enabling templates to better control the manipulation of multibyte characters.
Other changes include better performance for searches using the ANY() operators and more intelligent transaction handling for distribution jobs.
Here are the other highlights of this release:

Improvements



Bricolage now runs under a DSO mod_perl as long as it uses a Perl
compiled
with -Uusemymalloc or -Ubincompat5005. See The mod_perl
FAQ for details.

Alerts triggered to be sent to users who don't have the appropriate contact information will now be logged for those users so that they can see them and acknowledge them under My Alerts.

Added bric_media_dump script to contrib/.

The category association interface used in the story profile when the ENABLE_CATEGORY_BROWSER bricolage.conf directive is enabled now uses radio buttons instead of a link to select the primary category.
Suggested by Scott Lanning.

Existing jobs are now executed within their own transactions,
as opposed to no transaction specification.
This means that each job must succeed or fail independent of any other jobs.
New jobs are executed before being inserted into the database so as to keep them atomic within their surrounding transaction (generally a UI request).
All this means that transactionality is much more intelligent for jobs and will hopefully eliminate job table deadlocks.

All templates now execute with UTF-8 character strings enabled.
This means that any templates that convert content to other character sets might need to change the way they do so.
For example,
templates that had used <%filter> blocks to convert content to another encoding using something like Encode::from_to($_,
'utf-8',
$encoding) must now use something like $_ = Encode::encode($encoding,
$_),
instead.
Bric::Util::CharTrans should continue to do the right thing.

Added encoding attribute to Bric::Util::Burner so that,
if templates are outputting something other than Perl utf8 decoded data,
they can specify what they're outputting,
and the file opened for output from the templates will be set to the proper mode.
Applies to Perl 5.8.0 and later only.

Added SFTP_HOME bricolage.conf directive to specify the home directory and location of SSH keys when SSH is enabled.


Bug Fixes


make clone once again properly copies the lib/Makefile.PL and bin/Makefile.PL files from the source directory.

Added missing language-specifying HTML attributes so as to properly localize story titles and the like.

The list of output channels to add to an element in the element profile now contains the name of the site that each is associated with,
since different sites can have output channels with the same names.

The Advanced Search interface once again works for searching for related story and media documents.

Bricolage no longer attempts to email alerts to an empty list of recipients.
This will make your SMTP server happier.

The version numbering issues of Bricolage modules have all been worked out after the confusion in 1.8.1.
This incidentally allows the HTML::Template and Template Toolkit burners to be available again.

Misspelling the name of a key name tag or including a non-repeatable field more than once in Super Bulk Edit no longer causes all of the changes in that screen to be lost.

When a user overrides the global Date/Time Format and Time Zone preferences,
the affects of the overrides are now properly reflected in the UI.

Publishing a story or media document along with its related story or media documents from a publish desk again correctly publishes the original asset as well as the relateds.

Deleted output channels no longer show up in the select list for story type and media type elements.

Deleting a workflow from the workflow manager now properly updates the workflow cache so that the deleted workflow is removed from the left navigation without a restart.

When Bricolage notices that a document or template is not in workflow or on a desk when it should be,
it is now more intelligent in trying to select the correct workflow and/or desk to put it on,
based on current workflow context and user permissions.

Content submitted to Bricolage in the UTF-8 character set is now always has the utf8 flag set on the Perl strings that store it.
This allows fields that have a maximum length to be truncated to that length in characters instead of bytes.

Elements with autopopulated fields (e.g.,
for image documents) can now be created via the SOAP interface.

Fixed a number of the parameters to the list() method of the Story,
Media,
and Template classes to properly handle an argument using the ANY operator.
These include the keyword and category_uri parameters.
Passing an ANY argument to these parameters before this release could cause a well-populated database to lock up with an impossible query for hours at a time.

Template sandboxes now work for the Template Toolkit burner.

bodyâ=I can't believe I haven't posted this story here yet! I guess I've been busy. So here it is:

eWeek has reviewed Bricolage, the Perl-powered, PostgreSQL-backed open-source content management system. The article was published last week. An excerpt:

Bricolage is quite possibly the most capable enterprise-class open-source application available. The Web content management application features excellent administration capabilities, and it is highly extensible and capable of managing even the biggest and most complex Web sites. As an open-source product, Bricolage is free, and companies can now purchase support and development services from Kineticode.

The article is part of the Content Management Face-Off in the current issue of eWeek:

Included in this evaluation are the open-source Bricolage 1.8.1, Interwoven Inc.'s TeamSite 6.1, CrownPeak Technology Inc.'s Advantage CMS, Serena Software Inc.'s Collage 4.5, PaperThin Inc.'s CommonSpot Content Server 4.0 and Ektron Inc.'s CMS300 4.5. (The reviews are ordered, roughly, from the high end to the low end of the content management market.)

I'm pretty stoked about this review, as you might imagine. eWeek is now officially my favorite trade magazine!

bodyãKI've just finished updating the UML diagram for the design of Bricolage 2.0. It's not completely comprehensive, mainly because the lines would start criss-crossing all over the place and no one would never be able to make any sense of it, including me! Notably, I've left out the links to Bricolage::Biz::Site, Bricolage::Biz::Class, Bricolage::Party::Person::User, and Bricolage::Party::Person::Contributor. But it's pretty clear how they hook up if you study the classes, since they contain the appropriate *_guid attributes. And that's all those of us who will be writing Bricolage will need.

I'm happy to get this largely done. The technical specification is also largely complete. I'm going to fill in a bit on Bricolage::Client::CLI right now, but otherwise, it will probably be stable for a while. It will change of course, because it's not completely comprehensive, and there will be things that I haven't thought about as I'm starting to code. But that's probably a ways off, as there is quite a lot to get going with right now.

I'm not sure if I'll update the functional specification anytime soon. It's really out of date, but would take up quite a lot of time to rewrite, and for what benefit I'm not really sure at this point. The technical spec contains most of the information I need. Perhaps it will be time to update the functional spec once the API is nearing completeness and I start really working on the UI.

In the meantime, it's time to get back to hacking!

titleHow to Extend Bricolage 2.0
bodyçOGoing through the latest version of the Bricolage 2.0 technical specification, I can see at least six ways that developers will easily be able to extend Bricolage:


  Write a new task by subclassing Bricolage::Biz::Task
  A task can be designed to do just about anything to a single Bricolage object. Hell, you'd be able to look up other objects, too, so anything's possible. Tasks are run by scheduled jobs, event-triggered actions, or by distribution jobs.
  Create a new data type by subclassing Bricolage::Biz::Value and Bricolage::Biz::Type::Value
  We'll support quite a few different value types to start with, but we couldn't anticipate everything, so this'll be your chance!
  Create a new UI widget by subclassing Bricolage::Widget and Bricolage::Biz::Type::Widget
  Maybe your new value requires its own special widget. Or maybe you don't like the way the existing widgets handle other types of values. So write your own!
  Write a new distribution mover by subclassing Bricolage::Biz::Dist::Mover
  We'll start out with file system copy, SFTP, SFTP, and WebDAV distribution movers just as we have in Bricolage 1.8, but there's always room for more!
  Write a new authentication plugin by subclassing Bricolage::Util::Auth
  The built-in and LDAP-based authentication systems aren't doing it for you? You want to authenticate against a different database? Make it so!
  Write a new storage back-end by subclassing Bricolage::Store
  We'll have a PostgreSQL back-end from the start, and perhaps SQLite and/or MySQL. But here's your chance to get Bricolage running on FileMaker Pro just as you've always secretly desired!


So have fun with it! When it gets here. Want to help get get here? Subscribe to Bricolage-Devel and chip in!

title+Bricolage Tasks, Jobs, Actions, and Alerts
bodyûVI've been working on the design for what are called distribution jobs and
alerts in Bricolage 1.x. There were some good ideas there. Distribution jobs
enable users to set up a list of tasks to execute against the files being
distributed, such as validating them against a DTD or distributing them via
email. It also allowed developers to create fairly simple plugin modules that
could be added as new jobs. Alerts are great ways of letting users know that
some even has happened, and their rules-based evaluation of event attributes is
a powerful way of configuring alerts to be sent only for certain events logged
for certain objects.

The problem is that they're specific solutions to general problems.
Distribution job s are an example of scheduling arbitrary tasks to be executed,
while alerts are an example of triggering the execution of arbitrary tasks upon
the logging of an event. So what I've been working on is trying to generalize
these ideas into a simpler yet more powerful and flexible architecture. What
I've come with is this:

Tasks

Very simply, a task is an object of a class designed to perform a simple, um
task. Examples include publishing a document, expiring a document, sending an
alert, or validating a file against a DTD. An abstract base class,
Bricolage::Biz::Task, will establish the the interface for tasks, although its
subclasses may add their own attributes (such as the subject and message of an
alert). Each will implement an execute() method that will simply
carry out the task on the object passed to it. Some task classes may operate on
only one type of object (such as Task::Publish), while others may operate on
many or even all Bricolage business classes (such as Task::SendAlert). There is
no connection between task classes and events or jobs, except that the object
that called the task object's execute() method will be passed to
execute() as a second argument.

Actions

An action is an event-triggered series of tasks. New action types can be
created that have rules set to be evaluated against the event, just as is
currently the case for alert types in Bricolage 1.x. The difference is that
rather than being limited to sending alerts, actions types will be associated
with one or more task objects, and each of those tasks will be executed in
sequence when an action of that type is triggered. This will enable users to,
for example, configure an action to republish an index document whenever a story
document is published.

Jobs

A job is a scheduled series of tasks. Users will be able to create new jobs
for any single object in Bricolage, associate any number of task objects, and
then schedule the job to be run at some specific date and time in the future.
This approach will enable users to, for example, schedule a job to send an alert
about a given document one year in the future, as a reminder to update the
document.

Destinations

Destinations will be similar to what's currently in Bricolage 1.x. However,
rather than having job classes specific to distribution, they'll be able
to specify a list of any tasks that are designed to be executed against an output
file. This keeps the interface for tasks identical across all three uses.

Alerts

Alerts are no longer closely tied to events, since they can sent as part of a
scheduled job or as part of a distribution to a destination in addition to when
an event is logged. Rather, they will only be created by
Bricolage::Biz::Task::SendAlert. So a Bricolage business object can have any
number of associated alerts, just as it can have any number of associated
events.

Upshot

The upshot of this redesign, which took me several days of thinking to tease
out to be general enough to satisfy me, is that more users will have more of
what they need from Bricolage, and developers can more easily add new
functionality that's immediately available to event actions, scheduled jobs, and
distribution destinations.

bodyábPerl.com
has published the first in a series of articles I've promised to write, Content Management with Bricolage. The
article is targeted at organizational decision makers who need to evaluate
Bricolage as part of their selection of a content management solution. So I've
spent some time discussing what content management is and how Bricolage fits
in. I mention a lot of other CMSs as for comparative purposes, to try to
really give people a feel for how Bricolage can meet their needs.

I also go over some of Bricolage's most important features, such as
multisite management, document modeling, Perl templating, meaningful URLs,
workflow, and any number of outputs via output channels. The article
concludes with a list of sites known to be managed by Bricolage, as well as
the promise for more.

The next article in the series will cover installation and configuration.
Subsequent articles will cover document analysis and modeling, Mason templating,
and fun with the SOAP server. Enjoy!

title8Fun with <code>Module::Build</code> Argument Processing
bodyõ7I've spend the better part of the last two days working on a custom
subclass of Module::Build to build Bricolage 2.0. It's going to be a lot nicer
than the nasty custom Makefile that Bricolage 1.x uses. The
reason I'm creating a custom subclass of Module::Build is to be able to do
a lot of the extra stuff that building Bricolage requires. Such as:


  Copying configuration files from conf/ into blib
  Copying configuration files from conf/ into t for testing
  Copying configuration files from comp/ into blib
  Modifying Bricolage::Util::Config to contain a hard-coded reference to the location of bricolage.conf once Bricolage has been installed
  Modifying the contents of bricolage.conf to reflect build options (forthcoming)
  Modifying the contents of httpd.conf to reflect build options (forthcoming)


I'm sure there will be more as Bricolage develops (such as building the
database!), but this is enough for now. I've also been hacking on
Module::Build itself to add features I want. For example, I want users to be
able to pass options to Build.PL when they call it, so that it can do
silent installs. As it is, you can pass options now, but Module::Build's option
processing lacks flexibility. For example, you can pass options like this:

perl Build.PL opt1=val1 opt2=val2

And Module::Build will store the options in a hash like this:

{ "opt1" => "val1",
  "opt2" => "val2" }

It understands options that use --, too; This invocation

perl Build.PL --opt1 val1 --opt2 val2

produces the same hash. But be careful how you specify arguments! For
example, Modul::Build doesn't understand unary options or options that use
both -- and =>! To whit, this invocation

perl Build.PL --loud --opt1=val1 --opt2=val2 --foobar

Yields a hash like this:

{ "loud => "--opt1=val1",
  "opt2=val2" => "--foobar" }

Certainly not what I would expect! So to get great flexibility, I sent a patch to the Module::Build mail list adding a new parameter
to new():
get_options. This is an array reference of options that will be
passed to Getopt::Long::GetOptions() before Module::Build parses
arguments. It stores the results in the same hash as Moculde::Build normally
does, and options not specified in get_options will be processed
by Module::Build just as before. But it gives a whole lot more control over
what gets grabbed. For example, if I were to try to get that last example to
do what I want, all I'd need to do is pass in the appropriate
Getopt::Long specs:

my $build = Module::Build->new(
    module_name => "Spangly",
    get_options => [ "loud+", "opt1=s", "opt2=s", "foobar" ],
);

Now, the hash yielded is:

{ "loud   => "1",
  "opt1"   => "val1",
  "opt2"   => "val2",
  "foobar" => "1" }

Isn't that nicer? And because the full suite of Getopt::Long
specification is supported, you can get even fancier:

my $loud = 0;
my $build = Module::Build->new(
    module_name => "Spangly",
    get_options => [ "loud+" => \$loud, "foobar!" ],
);

Now this invocation:

perl Build.PL --loud --loud --nofoobar

...sets the $loudscalar to 2, while the args hash
is simply { "foobar" => "0" }. Cool, eh?

Now I've just been discussing the patch with Dave Rolsky on the mail list,
and he argues that, while this is a good idea in principal, he'd rather see a
data-structure based argument list rather than Getopt::Long's
magical strings. Perhaps Module::Build will end up Borging some of the
ideas from Getopt::Simple. But either way, I think that better
argument processing is on the way for Module::Build.

title#On Making a Better Open-Source CMS
body£1Jeffrey Veen posted some of his thoughts on the (dreary) state of open-source CMSs. So I just thought I'd comment on his thoughts. Keep your salt grains handy.

As a CMS developer, my point of view is quite naturally biased. However, I agree with some of Jeffrey's points, and disagree with others. Well, not disagree so much as wish to qualify. Many of your points betray a certain perspective that does not (and, naturally, cannot) apply to anyone and everyone who is evaluating content management systems. So let me just try to address each of your points and how they related to Bricolage.

Make it easy to install. Well, yes, of course, and I'll be the first to admit that Bricolage is difficult to install. But your requirement that you be able to install it from the browser just isn't feasible with a CMS that aims to scale to the needs of a large organization. The security implications alone make give me the heebee-jeebies. It's fine if you want to just manage your own personal site, but not if you're aiming to serve the complex needs of the corporate marketplace.

That said, it might be reasonable to create a simple installer that's useful for doing a local evaluation of a major CMS, one that doesn't rely on an RDBMS and an Apache Web server installation. (RT (not a CMS) has been working on a simple executable that uses an embedded database and Web server for those who want to evaluate it. For Bricolage, we at one time had a KNOPPIX CD that one could use to try it out. But for the rest, the best solution is probably an RPM, BSD Package, Debian package, or the like--something that can integrate the application into the base operating system.

Make it easy to get started. Bricolage is pretty bad about this, mostly because the default templates that come with it suck. That will change eventually, but the bigger issue is that when you have a complex, flexible application, it's tricky to present a simple getting started configuration without locking the user into just using that configuration (witness all the identical Microsoft Home Page sites on the 'Net to see what I mean). But that's no excuse for a system like Bricolage--those who need the more advanced features could take advantage of them when they're ready. It's just a matter of finding the tuits (or the volunteer) to make it happen.

Write task-based documentation first. In my experience, most complex open-source applications that have task-based documentation have it when they author a book. Yes, most of these systems have grown organically, and documentation gets written as volunteers make the time. But the best documentation I've found for open-source software has tended to be in published books. Though I think that trend is gradually changing.

Separate the administration of the CMS from the editing and managing of content. In Bricolage, you do not have to switch accounts to have access to the administrative tools. And although the administrative tools are part of the same UI, they have an entirely different section and set of navigation menus. Users who don't have permission to use those tools don't notice them.

Users of a public web site should never--never--be presented with a way to log into the CMS. Amen, brotha.

Stop it with the jargon already. Finding good terminology is hard, hard work. Bricolage is broken in this respect in a few ways, but I'm thinking of replacing jobs with fembots in 2.0. What do you think?

But seriously, we try to match the terms to what is commonly used, such as document, site, category, keyword, template, etc. Other terms, such as element (the parts of a document are its elements) are well-integrated into the system, so that users pick up on it very quickly.

Why do you insist Web sites have columns? I'm in complete agreement with you here. In Bricolage, you can write templates to output any kind of content you want, in any format you want. If you want columns, fine, generate them from Bricolage. If you want a standards-compliant layout, generate it from Bricolage. You can have 1998-era tables with Flash and you can have RSS feeds. Do what you want, make it flexible or make it complex.

But note that the flexibility comes at the price of complexity. And try as we might to make Bricolage The Macintosh of Content Management Systems, as long as the definition of the term Content Management System is all over the map, commonalities of metaphors, interfaces, and, well, philosophies between CMSs will continue to be all over the map.

But that's just my opinion.

bodyå

The launch of the new Bricolage Website went off without a hitch yesterday. The lack of sleep getting it all just so was worth it, in the end. And I'm very very pleased with the new site. It looks good, it's easy to navigate, it has really nice semantic XHTML 1.1 that degrades nicely in older browsers (check it out in Netscape Navigator 4.x or in lynx!

The new content on the site is good, too. There's a lot more information for people who have heard of Bricolage and are hitting the site for the first time to try to learn something about it. We now explain what it is and what it's for on the home page, and have a nice set of pages describing the benefits of Bricolage, listing the sites known to be powered by Bricolage, and providing screenshots to give folks a feel for how nice the Bricolage UI is. Special thanks to Marshall Roch for providing the new design and the home page content.

This is the first Bricolage Website to be managed in Bricolage itself. I decided to create the new site for a number of reasons, but two of the more important ones were: to have a nice example for conference and client presentations; and to be able to release the Bricolage Mason templates that generate the site. These templates have now been released and are available for download on the Bricolage Website. I've worked hard to try to make them really good examples of best practices in using Bricolage so that people can download them, study them, and be able to start writing smart templates for their on Bricolage implementations. So enjoy!

Roch, I'm just about ready to launch the new Bricolage Website. Thanks to
hardware and hosting provided by NetStumbler.com, we now have a fully
functioning Bricolage installation and Web server for the bricolage.cc domain.

The new site will launch just before my OSCON talk on Wednesday. In
addition to having the great Web standards-compliant layout (thanks Marshall!)
and a decent amount of extra content, the templates for the site will be made
available for download, too. The templates will make a great best
practices example, both for bricoleurs and Bricolage evaluators. I think
they nicely show off the flexibility of the Bricolage CMS platform.

So do you want to see the beta? I'm making it available only to my fellow
Bricolage developers and to you, the readers of my blog. Just point your
browser at www.bricolage.cc, and then just s/www/beta/ to see
the new site. I'm not providing a direct link to it here because it's going to
go away on Wednesday and I don't want to get any 404s. Feel free to send me
feedback on the new site--anything about it: design, layout, XHTML, CSS, etc.

bodyá*It looks like the Perl.org authentication system that handles authentication for svn.bricolage.cc doesn't properly cache an authentication token. Robert discovered this when a very large merge I was working on from the rev_1_8 branch of Bricolage to trunk was hanging and then timing out on me. The problem was that it was disconnecting from the MySQL server. Odd. At any rate, Robert switched over to an auth system that doesn't use MySQL so that I could do the merge and then the commit. This morning, he restored the original auth system. I shouldn't often have to do such a big merge or commit in Bricolage, so hopefully it won't come up again, but it sure was annoying there for a while.

So for my fellow Bricolage developers who thought that the auth system was down: Sorry, it's back now. And the trunk is fully updated with all of the changes to rev_1_8, which means that new development in the trunk can begin again in earnest.
