# Documentation: See the bottom of this file or type: perldoc wbnotify
# Requirements: writebacks -plugin and a sendmail compatible mailer (most on
#               unixen). On Windows, you can use 'Blat', a command-line
#               mailer. You can find it here: http://www.interlog.com/~tcharron/blat.html
#               (on windows you'll also have to modify the sendmail variable!)

package writebacknotify;

# --- Configurable variables -----

# Address that writebacks will be mailed to.
# *** This plugin will not action until you set it. ***
my $wbaddr = 'david@kineticode.com';
 
# Location of sendmail -executable. If default doesn't work, try to find the
# right location and replace this variable with it.
# This may help you find something suitable:
# for i in `locate sendmail`; do if [ -x $i ]; then echo $i; fi; done;
my $sendmail = "/usr/sbin/sendmail";

# --------------------------------

use CGI qw/:standard/;

sub start {
  unless ( $wbaddr ) {
    # We're not entitled to action as we don't know the target address
    warn "blosxom : wbnotify plugin > The \$wbaddr variable is not set; please set it to enable writeback notifications.\n";
    return 0;
  }
  # Only spring into action if POSTing to the writeback plug-in
  if ($writeback::success ) {
#  if ( request_method() eq 'POST' and (($blosxom::flavour eq 'trackback' && !param('tb_timeout')) or (param('plugin') eq 'writeback' and  param('z') == param('x') + param('y')))) {
